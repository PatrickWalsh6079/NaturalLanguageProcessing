0,Michael,All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
1,Jim,"Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So..."
2,Michael,"So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?"
3,Jim,"Actually, you called me in here, but yeah."
4,Michael,"All right. Well, let me show you how it's done."
5,Michael," Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So that's the way it's done."
6,Michael,"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?"
7,Pam,Well. I don't know.
8,Michael,"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. "
9,Pam,"Uh, yeah. Just a fax."
10,Michael,"Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate."
11,Pam,You haven't told me.
12,Michael,It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
13,Michael,"People say I am the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious."" ""And you get the best out of us.""  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts."
14,Dwight, Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum  I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum 
15,Jim,"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this."
16,Jim,Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
17,Michael,OK. All right. See you later.
18,Jim,All right. Take care.
19,Michael,"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah."
20,Michael,Um... Me no get an agenda.
21,Michael,I didn't get any agenda.
22,Michael,Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning?
23,Pam,"Uh, yeah, the one..."
24,Michael,"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?"
25,Pam,You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
26,Michael,"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes."
27,Michael,"Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you."
28,Michael,"No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent."
29,Michael,All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
30,Michael,"Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?"
31,Michael,"Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?"
32,Michael,"Oh, that's not appropriate."
33,Michael,"Uh, I don't know what you mean."
34,Michael,"Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person."
35,Michael,"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that."
36,Oscar,You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
37,Angela,I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
38,Kevin,"Yeah, it'll be you."
39,Pam,I have an important question for you.
40,Pam,Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
41,Jim,"Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous."
42,Michael,"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
43,Pam,This is Mr. Scott.
44,Michael,Guilty! Guilty as charged!
45,Ryan,Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
46,Michael,"Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges."
47,Michael,"Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. "
48,Pam,"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good."
49,Pam,Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
50,Jim,"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?"
51,Jim,What are you doing?
52,Dwight,Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
53,Jim,It's not on your desk.
54,Dwight,"It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation."
55,Dwight,You can't do that.
56,Dwight,Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
57,Jim, We'll see.  This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
58,Dwight,"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on."
59,Pam,You just still have these messages from yesterday.
60,Michael,"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. "
61,Michael,"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise."
62,Michael,"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. "
63,Michael,"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP."
64,Michael,"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable."
65,Michael,Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
66,Dwight,I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
67,Michael,Assistant to the Regional Manager.
68,Dwight,"OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?"
69,Michael,I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
70,Oscar,Can't you just tell us.
71,Dwight,"Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?"
72,Michael,You don't know what it is. 
73,Dwight,OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
74,Michael,I don't need your permission.
75,Michael,Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
76,Ryan,I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
77,Oscar,"Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?"
78,Michael,"It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that."
79,Dwight,On his mother's grave.
80,Michael,"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it."
81,Michael,"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then."
82,Pam,I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
83,Michael,"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings."
84,Dwight,"Pam, information is power."
85,Michael,"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."
86,Jim,"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry."
87,Pam,"Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... "
88,Michael,"Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp."
89,Ryan,What's up? Nice to meet you.
90,Michael,Introduce yourself. Be polite.
91,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager."
92,Michael,"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything."
93,Dwight,"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand."
94,Dwight,"New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos."
95,Michael,"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?"
96,Dwight,He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
97,Dwight,That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
98,Dwight,"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules."
99,Dwight,That is my stapler.
100,Michael,"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food."
101,Dwight,"OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him?"
102,Jim,How do you know it was me?
103,Dwight,It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
104,Michael,"Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop."
105,Michael,"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O."
106,Jim,"OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan."
107,Michael, Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
108,Ryan,You should've put him in custardy.
109,Michael,Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
110,Dwight,"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all."
111,Michael,Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
112,Jim,Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
113,Jim,That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
114,Pam,So when are we going out?
115,Pam,Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
116,Pam,Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
117,Pam,OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
118,Jim,You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
119,Jim,Um... What's in the bag?
120,Jim,"No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do."
121,Jim,Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? 
122,Michael,"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?"
123,Michael,"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?"
124,Michael,"Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to..."
125,Pam,You got a fax.
126,Michael,"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first."
127,Michael,"Why? Well, theft and stealing."
128,Pam,Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
129,Pam,"Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?"
130,Michael,"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam."
131,Pam,I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
132,Michael,But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
133,Michael," You been X'd punk!  Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you."
134,Michael,I don't know about that.
135,Michael,"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, ""Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?"" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked."
136,Pam,Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
137,Jim,"Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?"
138,Jim,Am I walking out?
139,Jim,"Yes, I... Do you want to..."
140,Jim,Great. Let me just...
141,Pam,"Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend."
142,Jim,"Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here."
143,Michael,"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?"
144,Michael,Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
145,Michael,"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited."
146,Jim,"That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, ""100% post-consumer content."" What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you.  Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second."
147,Jim,Do you really have to do that right now?
148,Dwight,Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
149,Jim,"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying...  Hello? Thanks, Dwight."
150,Dwight,Retaliation. Tit for tit.
151,Jim,That is not the expression.
152,Dwight,"Well, it should be."
153,Jim,"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?"
154,Pam,I know. I saw that.
155,Jim,"So then, why didn't you do it?"
156,Pam,I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
157,Jim,Who doesn't love that?
158,Michael,"Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?"
159,Michael,Did you have a good weekend going there?
160,Michael,"Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---"
161,Michael,"Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!"
162,Michael,"Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?"
163,Jim,"Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please."
164,Michael,"It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day."
165,Jim,You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
166,Michael,"Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!"
167,Michael,"You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race."
168,Michael,Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
169,Michael,You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
170,Dwight,I have two. White and Indian.
171,Dwight,A few of the ground rules?
172,Michael,"Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him."
173,Dwight,"OK, can we steer away from gay people?"
174,Dwight,"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox."
175,Dwight,I figured it would save time.
176,Michael,OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
177,Michael,"Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that."
178,Michael,"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?"
179,Michael,I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
180,Michael,"OK, I will play guy listening."
181,Michael,Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
182,Kevin,"Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess."
183,Michael,"OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid!"
184,Michael, They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
185,Michael, What you want a cookie?
186,Dwight,"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero."
187,Dwight,"A hero kills people, people that wish him harm."
188,Dwight,"A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged."
189,Dwight,We all have a hero in our heart.
190,Michael, I don't think I can sign this.
191,Michael,"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?"
192,Michael,"Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit."
193,Michael,"OK, well I know. You told me that several times."
194,Michael,"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't."
195,Michael,"""I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..."" Open-mindedness, is that even a word? ""...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.""  He's going to lose it when he reads that."
196,Jim,"Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you."
197,Michael,"""I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart."" I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, ""Mr. Brown,"" he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears."
198,Michael,All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
199,Michael,"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape."
200,Michael," Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, ""If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North."" And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace."
201,Michael,OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
202,Jim,": Uh, is that it?"
203,Michael,Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
204,Kevin,It was kind of hard to hear.
205,Michael,"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um..."
206,Michael,"Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian."
207,Oscar,What part Native American?
208,Oscar,"Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense."
209,Michael,"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on."
210,Oscar,"OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico."
211,Oscar,"And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States."
212,Oscar,My parents were Mexican.
213,Michael,"Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?"
214,Michael,"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?"
215,Michael,"Well, it has certain connotations."
216,Michael,Like... I don't... I don't know.
217,Oscar,"What connotations, Michael? You meant something."
218,Michael,"No. Now, remember that honesty..."
219,Michael,"...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!"
220,Michael,"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done."
221,Michael,Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
222,Michael,Oh this is a good one.
223,Pam,"Um, hi. How are you?"
224,Michael,Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
225,Michael,"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that."
226,Dwight,"Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me."
227,Dwight,Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
228,Dwight,"OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick."
229,Pam,"OK, I like your food."
230,Dwight,"Outback steakhouse.  I'm Australian, mate!"
231,Michael,"Pam, come on. ""I like your food."" Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real."
232,Pam,"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver."
233,Dwight,"Oh, man, am I a woman?"
234,Michael,"You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. ""Too soon for Arabs."" Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court."
235,Jim,What are you watching?
236,Ryan,I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
237,Jim,No way. I think she likes this stuff.
238,Ryan,"Great. She's cute, huh?"
239,Jim,"Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but..."
240,Ryan,"Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch."
241,Jim,"Oh, yeah. She's hot."
242,Kevin,You wanna go to the beach?
243,Kevin,You wanna get high?
244,Kevin,"I think you do, mon."
245,Michael,OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
246,Michael," Kelly, how are you?"
247,Michael,"Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my... "
248,Michael," All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority."
249,Jim," Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you."
250,Michael,"I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food."
251,Michael,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai."
252,Michael,"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice."
253,Jim,Uh... Not a bad day.
254,Michael,Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
255,Pam,I'm not making any copies.
256,Michael,"Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway."
257,Michael,Lay them on me. What?
258,Michael,That's not what you said earlier.
259,Pam,"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... "
260,Michael,"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist."
261,Michael,"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works."
262,Michael,I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
263,Michael,"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good."
264,Michael,You gotta crack these things open.
265,Michael,"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice."
266,Michael,"Well, it's a suicide mission, you know."
267,Michael, When have you ever done that?
268,Jim,"Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?"
269,Pam,No. I have a life.
270,Jim,"Interesting, what's that like?"
271,Pam,You should try it sometime.
272,Jim,Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
273,Michael,Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
274,Michael,"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers."
275,Jim,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
276,Jim,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?"
277,Jim,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it."
278,Dwight,Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
279,Jim,"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train."
280,Dwight,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?"
281,Michael,"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan."
282,Dwight,"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine."
283,Michael,You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
284,Dwight," Yes, I have an office.  Bigger than his."
285,Michael,"Nope, you cannot use it."
286,Dwight,"OK, I take it back, it's a workspace."
287,Michael,Temporary workspace. You can use it.
288,Michael,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already."
289,Dwight,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
290,Dwight,"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, ""Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead."" Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead."
291,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
292,Michael," Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?"
293,Michael,"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?"
294,Pam,"Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the..."
295,Michael,"Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call."
296,Michael,"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?"
297,Michael,"Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this."
298,Pam,Still no one calling.
299,Dwight,"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office."
300,Jim,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write ""workspace""?"
301,Dwight,"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior."
302,Jim,You are not my superior.
303,Dwight,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?"
304,Jim,I thought it was a workspace?
305,Pam,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
306,Dwight,Yes. And my decision in final.
307,Pam,This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
308,Dwight,"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it."
309,Jim,"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?"
310,Jim,"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?"
311,Dwight,Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
312,Jim,"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies."
313,Dwight,"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will."
314,Pam,Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
315,Dwight,So I can lower it.
316,Oscar,He literally won't come out of his office.
317,Kevin,He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
318,Oscar,"Michael, can I talk to you?"
319,Michael,"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?"
320,Michael,"Ah, what? Which memo?"
321,Pam,Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
322,Michael,Is it a good plan?
323,Dwight,It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
324,Oscar,It's like a pay decrease.
325,Pam,"Michael, he made huge cuts."
326,Michael,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?"
327,Michael,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?"
328,Dwight,I can handle that.
329,Michael,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?"
330,Oscar,This is not good.
331,Angela,It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
332,Angela,You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
333,Kevin,What are you guys talking about?
334,Dwight,"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do."
335,Jim,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential."
336,Dwight,"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office."
337,Michael,You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
338,Pam,Where are you going?
339,Michael,"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldn't find the knob."
340,Michael,"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend."
341,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so..."
342,Jim,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
343,Pam,I'm inventing new diseases.
344,Pam,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?"
345,Jim,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
346,Michael," Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride."
347,Michael,Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
348,Michael,So it's not a free fall?
349,Michael,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?"
350,Michael,"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?"
351,Dwight,"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them."
352,Jim,What are you talking about?
353,Dwight,"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony."
354,Jim,"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?"
355,Dwight,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection."
356,Dwight,"You did this, didn't you?"
357,Dwight,"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!"
358,Dwight,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.  ""Count Choculitis"""
359,Dwight,Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
360,Dwight,I think you need to confess...
361,Dwight,What are you doing? Those are my keys.
362,Dwight,Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... 
363,Dwight,Let me out or you're fired.
364,Jim,"No, you can't fire me."
365,Dwight,Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
366,Jim,"OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert."
367,Pam," Hey, Jim. It's Pam."
368,Jim,Hey Pam! How are you?
369,Dwight,Jim! Open the door!
370,Pam,"Good, how are you? Busy?"
371,Jim,I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
372,Pam,"Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?"
373,Jim,"No, not at all."
374,Pam,You don't have anything you're doing?
375,Jim,I have nothing to do.
376,Pam,"Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything."
377,Pam,I might go to the mall.
378,Pam,I need new shoes.
379,Jim,"Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?"
380,Dwight,"Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould."
381,Dwight,"Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert."
382,Dwight,He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
383,Dwight,"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan."
384,Dwight,"Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?"
385,Dwight,"Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... "
386,Michael,"Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!  Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism."
387,Ryan,Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
388,Michael,"Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly."
389,Michael,"Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it."
390,Dwight,"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options."
391,Dwight,"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered."
392,Dwight,"You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s."
393,Dwight,I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
394,Dwight,"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? anal fissures?"
395,Kevin,That's a real thing.
396,Dwight,"Yeah, but no one here has it."
397,Kevin,Do you think we should go ?
398,Oscar,"I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want...  There he is."
399,Kevin,What is he doing?
400,Michael,"Well, what? You could be referring to anything."
401,Oscar,"OK, the health care plan."
402,Pam,Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
403,Michael,"Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?"
404,Dwight,I most certainly did not.
405,Michael,"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday."
406,Angela,What about the surprise?
407,Michael,"Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?"
408,Michael,"All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!"
409,Michael,"When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."
410,Michael," God, yeah... Ah! This..."
411,Michael,"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo."
412,Dwight,"Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her."
413,Michael,"Oh! God. Dwight, come on..."
414,Dwight,I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
415,Dwight,"I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?"
416,Michael,Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
417,Dwight,"Yeah, so I don't have to worry?"
418,Michael,"Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?"
419,Michael,"But there's no downsizing, so just don't..."
420,Dwight,Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
421,Michael,"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe."
422,Michael,"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, ""You're fired.""  ""You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed."" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way.  ""You're foir-ed."" I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, ""You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want."" But that's unrealistic, so..."
423,Dwight,"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work."
424,Dwight,"I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?"
425,Michael,"Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?"
426,Michael,Who is it? Who's the birthday?
427,Pam,"Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up."
428,Michael,Next person on the...
429,Pam,"Okay, umm... that would be Meredith."
430,Michael,"Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!"
431,Pam,But it's not until next month.
432,Michael,"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise."
433,Pam,You still want to have a party?
434,Michael,"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!"
435,Michael," Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek."
436,Angela,"No, yeah, I think that's a good idea."
437,Angela,What color do you guys think?
438,Angela,I think green is kind of whoreish.
439,Pam,This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
440,Michael,These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
441,Michael,"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious."
442,Angela,"Meredith's allergic to dairy, so..."
443,Michael,"She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so..."
444,Pam,It is... her birthday.
445,Michael,"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?"
446,Dwight,"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out."
447,Dwight,"Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?"
448,Dwight,"Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected..."
449,Jim,"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me."
450,Dwight,Did you get your tickets?
451,Jim,"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says ""No, Jim, here's a way."""
452,Dwight,There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
453,Pam,What does that even mean?
454,Jim,"I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure."
455,Jim,"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground."
456,Dwight,"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?"
457,Dwight,Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
458,Jim,"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam."
459,Dwight,"Right, that's good, good, pursue this."
460,Jim,Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
461,Jim,"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away."
462,Michael," Can you get her? She's right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, ""Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers."" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, ""Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."" "
463,Dwight,"They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?"
464,Jim,"Yeah, what do you think that's about?"
465,Dwight,Only one way to find out.
466,Jim,You are not going to believe this.
467,Dwight,What? I believe it.
468,Jim,"Well, tensions were high in the kitchen."
469,Dwight,"I could tell, from the body language."
470,Jim,"Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?"
471,Jim,"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone..."
472,Jim,"Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off."
473,Dwight,"Good, let 'em. It helps our cause."
474,Jim,"Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking..."
475,Dwight,"Oh, they're forming an alliance"
476,Jim,I love their sandwiches too.
477,Kevin,Their bread's really good.
478,Jim,Their bread is very good.
479,Jim,"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off."
480,Dwight,God... Damn it! Why us?
481,Jim,"Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong."
482,Michael," Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor."
483,Michael,"Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?"
484,Oscar,"Uh, I'm sorry to bother you."
485,Michael,"Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?"
486,Oscar,"My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if..."
487,Oscar,Donate to the charity?
488,Michael,"Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here."
489,Michael,"No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25."
490,Oscar,That's... that's... that's very generous.
491,Michael,"Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so..."
492,Pam," Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?"
493,Pam,"Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?"
494,Pam,"Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, ""These people are my friends."" But he's all like, ""This is confidential. You can't tell anybody."" But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything."
495,Jim,"No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me."
496,Jim,That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
497,Michael," Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
498,Dwight,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
499,Michael,Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
500,Dwight,I don't think she'd be missed.
501,Michael,"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend."
502,Dwight,"Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies."
503,Michael,"I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside."
504,Dwight,She had a hysterectomy.
505,Michael, Which one is that again?
506,Dwight,That's where they remove the uterus.
507,Michael,"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?"
508,Dwight,It could be kind of funny.
509,Michael,"You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time."
510,Jim,"OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday."
511,Dwight,"Oh my God, we have to be there."
512,Jim,"I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there."
513,Dwight,"No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God."
514,Dwight,I know. I know exactly what to do.
515,Dwight,"I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
516,Dwight,"This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything."
517,Ryan,Michael? Are you done yet?
518,Michael,"Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet."
519,Jim,"Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open."
520,Dwight,So tape it down.
521,Jim,I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
522,Dwight,"Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box."
523,Jim,"Thank you, thank you. OK."
524,Michael,"It's surprise Meredith. One, two..."
525,Jim,"So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?"
526,Dwight,"No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone."
527,Dwight,"Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me."
528,Michael,"You were surprised, weren't you?"
529,Michael,"You looked freaked, man. We said ""Surprise."" You were, like, ""What?"" ""What the hell's goin' on here?"" Good cake. Why don't you have some?"
530,Michael,Come on. A little bit.
531,Michael,"Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good."
532,Michael,"You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good."
533,Pam,He's in a box?
534,Jim,"Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic."
535,Pam," Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that..."
536,Michael,"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal."
537,Jim,"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?"
538,Michael,"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time."
539,Jim,"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give."
540,Michael,"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so..."
541,Oscar,"Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is."
542,Oscar,"It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, ""However many dollars per mile."""
543,Michael,Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
544,Oscar,I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
545,Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?"
546,Michael,How many miles did he do last year?
547,Oscar,"Last year, he walked 18 miles."
548,Michael,Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
549,Michael,Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
550,Michael, I don't know about that.
551,Michael,Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
552,Michael," You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... ""Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back."" 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?"
553,Michael,"Divorce. Um... OK, ""Meredith is so old..."""
554,Oscar,How old is she?
555,Michael,"Everybody? If... could do it? ""Meredith is so old..."""
556,Michael,"""She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."""
557,Michael,"That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me."
558,Oscar,"Uh, nice party Michael."
559,Michael,"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that."
560,Angela,"Phyllis wanted red, I didn't."
561,Michael,"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25."
562,Michael,"When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back."
563,Michael,"A check for the kids, and for the team."
564,Michael,"I want it to be like... ""Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?"" ""Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous."" ""Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott."" ""But it was anonymous, how do you know?"" ""Because I'm him."""
565,Michael,"Come here.  Don't cash that till Friday, OK?"
566,Ryan,"No, don't. Don't do that."
567,Jim,"OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box."
568,Pam,"Oh, tell me, tell me."
569,Jim,OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no.
570,Jim,"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover."
571,Jim,If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
572,Jim,"No, no, dude, no."
573,Jim,"No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa."
574,Jim,"God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um..."
575,Pam,It's just office pranks.
576,Jim,"It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks."
577,Dwight,I have absolutely no idea.
578,Dwight,"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves."
579,Dwight," That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson."
580,Michael,"All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent."
581,Michael,"Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, ""This might be kinda fun."" And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together."
582,Michael,"Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you."
583,Dwight,"Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team."
584,Michael,"No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior."
585,Michael, When I let him come to my pick-up game...
586,Dwight,I apologized for that.
587,Michael, I vouched for you.
588,Michael,"I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar."
589,Dwight,I can handle that.
590,Michael,"Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that."
591,Dwight,And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
592,Michael,Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
593,Michael,"No, it's not. It's lower, so..."
594,Dwight,"So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim."
595,Jim,"God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?"
596,Pam,"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding."
597,Michael,"All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right."
598,Ryan,"Fine, don't worry about that."
599,Michael,"And here we have ""Mister Roger's Neighborhood."" Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs."
600,Michael,And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
601,Darryl,It's not my real name.
602,Michael,"No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs."
603,Darryl,"Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers."
604,Michael," And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs."
605,Michael,"You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!"
606,Pam," No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years."
607,Jim,"Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago."
608,Michael,"So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on."
609,Darryl,We're loading at one.
610,Michael,"Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me."
611,Darryl,"No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time."
612,Michael,"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. "
613,Darryl,"All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock."
614,Michael,"All right, see you at one."
615,Michael,Are we ready for the game?
616,Michael,"I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings."
617,Michael,Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
618,Dwight,Just trying to be helpful.
619,Michael,"Uh,  ""I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."""
620,Michael,"OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course."
621,Michael,"Um, what do you play? Center?"
622,Michael,"Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that."
623,Jim,"Uh, I heard it."
624,Michael,"Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time."
625,Michael," Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart."
626,Ryan,"But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?"
627,Michael,"Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?"
628,Oscar,"I can help out, if you need me."
629,Michael,"I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
630,Kevin,I have a hoop in my driveway.
631,Dwight,"Michael, look.  Missed it..."
632,Michael,"Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight."
633,Dwight,Can I be team captain?
634,Michael,"No, I'm team captain."
635,Dwight,Can I be team manager?
636,Michael,"No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager."
637,Dwight,"OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then."
638,Michael,"Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now."
639,Pam,Please don't throw garbage at me.
640,Michael,"Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?"
641,Pam,"I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance."
642,Jim,"I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and..."
643,Michael,"Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying."
644,Pam,Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
645,Michael,"Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good."
646,Michael,"Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?"
647,Darryl,Just getting a tea bag.
648,Michael,"Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!"
649,Darryl,Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
650,Michael,"Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday."
651,Darryl,"No, that's not as much fun. You know what?"
652,Michael,"OK. Cool, you're on.  Don't screw this up."
653,Michael," Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game."
654,Angela,"Has anyone seen the first-aid kit?  How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you."
655,Jim,"Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here."
656,Pam,"Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones."
657,Jim,You gonna wish me luck?
658,Pam,"Yeah, you're gonna need it."
659,Jim,Is that trash talk from Pam?
660,Pam," I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive."
661,Pam,And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
662,Jim,"Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along."
663,Pam,"Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake."
664,Jim,I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
665,Michael,"Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it."
666,Jim,Have a good game man.
667,Michael,"All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?"
668,Ryan,I stretched before I came.
669,Michael,"OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy."
670,Jim,Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
671,Michael,"Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys."
672,Dwight," OK, we'll be skins!"
673,Michael,"Aw, come on Dwight."
674,Dwight,What? Shirts on or off?
675,Michael,On. Just put it on.
676,Michael,"Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?"
677,Michael,Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Oh... Here we go!  Who's on him? Somebody get him!
678,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Here we go. Three!  Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!"
679,Michael," Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those.  Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go."
680,Michael," OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul."
681,Michael,"OK, I'll take it.  OK."
682,Michael,"When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone."
683,Michael, What is wrong with me today?!
684,Michael,"Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually."
685,Michael,"Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa!"
686,Darryl, Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
687,Michael,That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
688,Ryan,"Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine."
689,Darryl,You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
690,Michael,"Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!"
691,Dwight, Yeah!  In your face!
692,Michael,"You know what? Dwight, Dwight..."
693,Michael,"Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like...  Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah..."
694,Michael," Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter..."
695,Michael,"All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!"
696,Michael,What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
697,Jim,You know what? Let me take Roy.
698,Michael,"All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on."
699,Michael,"Shoot, shoot it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up."
700,Michael," Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?"
701,Michael," Watch the long passes, you guys!"
702,Michael," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?"
703,Michael,"Yeah, baby, here we go!"
704,Michael, Jim! Jim! Right here!  Ow! God! Hold it!
705,Michael,"What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?"
706,Darryl,Take your shot man!
707,Michael,"No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there."
708,Michael," Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair."
709,Michael,"Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly."
710,Angela,This is a cold pack...
711,Dwight,"Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. "
712,Michael,"Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won."
713,Michael,"It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face."
714,Darryl,"Yeah, this isn't happening."
715,Michael,"Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so..."
716,Michael," You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word."
717,Jim," ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good."
718,Jim,I didn't sign anything.
719,Pam,"Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh?  Let's get you into a tub."
720,Michael,"Hey, what a game, huh? What a game."
721,Oscar,What time do we have to come in?
722,Michael,"Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend."
723,Michael,The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.
724,Michael,"You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said..."
725,Michael,"Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!"
726,Michael,"Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?"
727,Michael,"Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to..."
728,Michael,I didn't mean me!
729,Michael,"Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else."
730,Michael,It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.
731,Michael,"Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid."
732,Pam,There's a person here...
733,Michael,And shake! What? Go ahead.
734,Pam,There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.
735,Michael,"No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction."
736,Pam,"Okay, I told her you'd talk to her."
737,Michael,"Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away."
738,Michael," Oooh, alright I'll talk to her."
739,Michael,"All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse."
740,Dwight,Cocks in the henhouse.
741,Michael,"Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?"
742,Michael,"Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
743,Michael,"Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace."
744,Michael,Nobody cares what you think.
745,Michael,"So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day."
746,Pam,There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
747,Michael,"Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman."
748,Michael,"I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating."
749,Michael,"This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall.  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be."
750,Michael,"So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here."
751,Michael,"Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks."
752,Michael,"It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here."
753,Michael,"Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb"
754,Michael,"No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?"
755,Michael,"Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right."
756,Kevin,So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
757,Kevin,She's prettier than you though.
758,Pam,"That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin."
759,Dwight,"The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
760,Michael, There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
761,Michael,"I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?"
762,Michael,"Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?"
763,Ryan,I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
764,Michael,"Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?"
765,Michael,"You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy."
766,Oscar,I'm on the phone.
767,Michael,Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
768,Michael,I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
769,Michael,"I know, it's unbelievable."
770,Pam,"It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with."
771,Michael,"Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby."
772,Michael,"Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?"
773,Michael,"You and your wife, and you have kids."
774,Michael,Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
775,Michael,"Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit.  Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work."
776,Michael,"I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
777,Jim,She's not really my type.
778,Jim,"Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope."
779,Kevin,What is your type?
780,Jim," Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really."
781,Kevin,Stay away from my mom.
782,Pam,"We're not dating, we're engaged."
783,Jim,"Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems."
784,Jim,She'd be perfect for you.
785,Dwight,Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
786,Jim,"So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager."
787,Dwight,Assistant to the Regional Manager.
788,Jim,"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss."
789,Jim,"Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there."
790,Dwight,True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
791,Jim,"Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back."
792,Jim,You buy a purse.
793,Dwight,I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
794,Jim,"Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?"
795,Jim,"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them."
796,Jim,"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her."
797,Dwight,"Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going..."
798,Jim,No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
799,Jim,"Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good."
800,Jim," Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?"
801,Pam," Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
802,Jim,"Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens."
803,Jim,Oh! That was really.  This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
804,Jim,"I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?"
805,Pam,"Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad."
806,Jim," Here he comes, shhh..."
807,Jim,He did pick a good one.
808,Michael,"Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?"
809,Michael,"Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?"
810,Michael,"Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones."
811,Michael,Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
812,Michael,"Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!"
813,Michael,"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!"
814,Michael," Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? What's the matter?"
815,Michael,"Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?"
816,Michael,Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
817,Michael,"God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp."
818,Michael,"I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves."
819,Michael,Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
820,Michael,"Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay."
821,Michael,I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
822,Dwight,It's actually better this way.
823,Michael,No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
824,Dwight,Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
825,Michael,"No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not."
826,Dwight,"Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much."
827,Michael,But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
828,Michael,She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
829,Dwight,Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
830,Michael,"Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot..."
831,Dwight,"Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?"
832,Michael,No. I cannot promise you that.
833,Dwight,"You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?"
834,Dwight,Do you love her?
835,Michael," Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. "
836,Michael,You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
837,Michael,Very easy to clean.
838,Michael,"Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? "
839,Michael,Did we get any mail?
840,Pam,"Yeah, I gave it to you."
841,Michael,"Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and..."
842,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
843,Jim,He's a grown man
844,Pam,That's what he said.
845,Jim,"That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. "
846,Pam," Stop, I can't breathe."
847,Pam,Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
848,Angela,I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
849,Dwight,"Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?"
850,Dwight,It will just take a second.
851,Dwight,Just for a minute.
852,Dwight,Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
853,Dwight,"Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?"
854,Angela,Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
855,Michael,Would you like to help me with a special project?
856,Ryan,I would love to.
857,Michael," Okay, just throw out all the empties."
858,Ryan,You don't want to recycle them?
859,Michael,"Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin."
860,Ryan,Do you want this? 
861,Ryan,What about this bottle of power drink?
862,Michael,Blue's not a flavor.
863,Ryan,It says flavor: Blue Blast.
864,Michael,"Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you."
865,Jim,"I'm Jim, by the way."
866,Jim,"Hi Katy, nice to meet you."
867,Jim,"I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses."
868,Jim,"Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn."
869,Jim,"Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can..."
870,Michael,"What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir."
871,Ryan,"No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept."
872,Michael,"No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it."
873,Michael,"Not it's not, there's some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out."
874,Ryan,Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
875,Michael,"That's over several months, Ryan."
876,Jim,Thank you for choosing me.
877,Pam,"No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?"
878,Jim,"Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy."
879,Pam,What are you guys going to do?
880,Jim,"Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos."
881,Jim,What are you doing?
882,Pam,"I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move."
883,Pam,'Cause Roy's got a truck.
884,Jim,"That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?"
885,Pam,"Okay, I'm gonna head back."
886,Michael,"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know."
887,Michael,Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
888,Michael,"See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim."
889,Jim,"I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?"
890,Michael,"Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool."
891,Michael,Don't drink and drive.
892,Jim,Have a good night.
893,Michael,"You too, have a good night."
894,Jim,"Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter."
895,Jim,"Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?"
896,Jim,"This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay."
897,Jim,You're not going to freak out?
898,Michael,"Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning."
899,Michael,"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, ""Hey, did you get an award?"" And the neighbor will say, ""No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me."" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So..."
900,Jim,"So, you ready for the... the Dundies?"
901,Pam,"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you."
902,Michael, Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
903,Michael, Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.
904,Michael,"So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?"
905,Jim,"Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky."
906,Michael,"Oh, that's a good idea."
907,Dwight,Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
908,Michael,Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
909,Michael,"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say ""Don't go there"" but that's... lame."
910,Michael,"And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling."
911,Michael,"Oh, no you di-int."
912,Michael,"Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them."
913,Michael," To Oscar Martinez it's the ""Show Me the Money"" award! Yeah!"
914,Oscar, That's supposed to be confidential.
915,Michael," He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!"
916,Michael," A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing..."
917,Michael,...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
918,Pam,"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
919,Michael," ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of..."
920,Pam, It wasn't. I swear.
921,Dwight,"So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either."
922,Pam,"We're not laughing at you, Dwight."
923,Dwight,So who are we laughing at?
924,Pam,"Um, just something somebody wrote."
925,Dwight,What is it? Who wrote it?
926,Pam,"Um, it's kind of private."
927,Dwight,"That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less."
928,Pam,"Okay, now I'm laughing at you."
929,Michael," Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?"
930,Michael,"Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home."
931,Michael,"Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So..."
932,Michael,"Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that."
933,Michael,"Um, what, ah, what is, I mean..."
934,Michael,You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
935,Michael,"Well, yeah, I mean, what is..."
936,Michael,No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
937,Michael,...it happens once every billion years.
938,Michael,"Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N."
939,Michael,"Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage."
940,Michael,"This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters.  Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.  ""Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."" Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
941,Dwight,"No, no, no, no..."
942,Dwight,"...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think."
943,Dwight,"No, why were you in there?!"
944,Dwight,What were you doing in there?
945,Michael," The Dundie award for ""Longest Engagement"" goes to Pam Beesley."
946,Michael,"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting."
947,Michael," Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?"
948,Michael," Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!"
949,Michael,"I'm not changing that, it's the best one."
950,Jim,"No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, ""world's longest engagement"", um, we're all expecting it, you know?"
951,Michael,"That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier."
952,Jim,Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
953,Michael,"Oh,  lazy. Uh huh."
954,Dwight,"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom."
955,Pam,You're taking away our bathroom?
956,Dwight,We are going to have two men's rooms.
957,Dwight,Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to...
958,Pam,...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
959,Michael,"Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now."
960,Dwight,"Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions..."
961,Michael,"Just don't, don't talk-"
962,Michael,Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
963,Michael,"Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us."
964,Michael,"Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever."
965,Dwight,Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
966,Dwight,"Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it.  Devon!"
967,Michael,"""The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.""  Card!"
968,Oscar,"The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like."
969,Michael,"""You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"""
970,Dwight,The waitress tripped on the cord.
971,Michael,"Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
972,Kevin," Oh, just put these on the group tab."
973,Michael,"Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks."
974,Michael,I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
975,Michael,"Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri."
976,Michael," Shut it.  Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight."
977,Dwight,Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
978,Michael,"No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy."
979,Michael,And I was about to take her bra off...
980,Michael,...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
981,Dwight,Like an AIDS test?
982,Michael," Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted."
983,Darryl,Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.
984,Michael,"Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started."
985,Jim,"Yeah, gotta eat somewhere."
986,Michael,"And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts..."
987,Michael,"...the ""Busiest Beaver"" award goes to Phyllis Lapin."
988,Michael,"Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual."
989,Michael,What? I told them busiest...idiots.
990,Michael,"Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that."
991,Pam,...because that's what happens every time!
992,Pam," No, I don't want to go, I don't want to."
993,Pam,"If you would have asked me that, then you would know."
994,Michael, Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
995,Jim,Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
996,Pam,"Oh no, I just, I decided to stay."
997,Pam,I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
998,Pam,"Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping."
999,Michael," Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny."
1000,Michael,Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
1001,Pam, Can I get a drink?
1002,Michael,"This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office."
1003,Michael,"Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The ""Hottest in the Office"" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!"
1004,Michael,"Yeah.  ""Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you."" Here you go."
1005,Ryan,What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
1006,Michael,"And the ""Tight Ass"" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down."
1007,Jim, I think those might be empty.
1008,Pam,"No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! "
1009,Michael,"The ""Spicy Curry"" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go."
1010,Michael,"Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke."
1011,Michael,"I don't know, it's just..."
1012,Michael,I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
1013,Michael,Just sit down Kelly.
1014,Michael," It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.  Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go."
1015,Michael," ""You have won a tiny Dundie."""
1016,Michael,"Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?"
1017,Michael,"Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh..."
1018,Michael," Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-"
1019,Michael,"  I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened.  This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the ""Don't Go in There After Me"" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So..."
1020,Pam,Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
1021,Pam,"Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet!"
1022,Jim,"Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going."
1023,Michael," Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year."
1024,Pam,Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
1025,Michael,You know you did.
1026,Pam,"Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech "
1027,Michael,And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
1028,Michael,...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
1029,Michael,"It is the ""Whitest Sneakers"" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!"
1030,Michael,"Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen!  Oh, here we go."
1031,Pam,I have so many people to thank for this award.
1032,Pam,"Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them.  Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because  this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too."
1033,Pam,"Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie."
1034,Pam,"And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!"
1035,Michael,Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.
1036,Jim,What a great year for the Dundies.
1037,Jim,"We got to see Ping.  And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan.  Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs.  Which for me, has ruined them for life. "
1038,Jim,"I don't know, what?"
1039,Jim,Oh my God! You are so drunk!
1040,Jim,Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
1041,Dwight,"Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy."
1042,Dwight,Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
1043,Jim,"Dwight come on, come-"
1044,Dwight,"It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt."
1045,Pam,"Dwight, get off me!"
1046,Michael,"Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost."
1047,Pam,"I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!"
1048,Dwight,"Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion."
1049,Michael,"Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work."
1050,Pam,I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
1051,Jim,"Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there."
1052,Pam,"Hey, um, can I ask you a question?"
1053,Pam,"Um, I just wanted to say thanks."
1054,Jim,"Not really a question.  Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk."
1055,Jim,"Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela."
1056,Jim,Um... I don't think so.
1057,Michael,No? Um... Check your spam folder.
1058,Jim,Oh! There it is!
1059,Jim,Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
1060,Michael,"I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer."
1061,Dwight,So the monkey does the s*x thing right here! 
1062,Michael,That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
1063,Dwight,Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
1064,Michael,"Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's...  Whup! Come on! Hey!"
1065,Michael,"Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!"
1066,Michael,"Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him."
1067,Michael,"Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So..."
1068,Michael,"Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why."
1069,Michael,Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
1070,Michael,"Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there."
1071,Michael,Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
1072,Michael,"Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button."
1073,Jim,"Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy!"
1074,Michael,Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan? 
1075,Michael,Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
1076,Jim,Except pass that breathalyzer.
1077,Ryan,You a big William Hung fan?
1078,Jim,I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
1079,Pam,My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
1080,Pam,I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
1081,Jim,Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
1082,Jim,"Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?"
1083,Michael,"Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot."
1084,Michael,"Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. ""Old School""."
1085,Michael,Um... literally two seconds?
1086,Michael,Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
1087,Michael,"No, no, Toby. No."
1088,Michael,"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!"
1089,Michael,"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?"
1090,Michael,There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
1091,Michael,"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away."
1092,Michael,"I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it."
1093,Michael,"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake."
1094,Michael,"Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?"
1095,Darryl,Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
1096,Michael,"Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day."
1097,Darryl,"Well,  those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?"
1098,Michael,"Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense."
1099,Darryl,"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with."
1100,Michael,"Oooh, okay. That was still about me."
1101,Michael,I don't feel bad.
1102,Darryl, I think he feels bad.
1103,Michael,"Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys."
1104,Darryl,Hiding from his momma.
1105,Pam,"Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today."
1106,Pam,Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
1107,Pam,She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
1108,Michael,"Hi, is it over?"
1109,Michael,"I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over."
1110,Michael,"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?"
1111,Michael,Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
1112,Angela,I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
1113,Michael,"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?"
1114,Michael,"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have."
1115,Michael,No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
1116,Michael,She would have definitely slept with me.
1117,Kevin,She wasn't that hot.
1118,Michael,"Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!"
1119,Jim,"I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it."
1120,Michael,"What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?"
1121,Michael,What if they made out? In front of everybody?
1122,Michael,At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
1123,Michael,"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?"
1124,Michael,"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?"
1125,Jim,"No, thanks. I'm good."
1126,Michael,That's what she said. Pam?
1127,Pam,Uh... my mother's coming.
1128,Michael,"That's what she sai  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself."
1129,Dwight,You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
1130,Dwight,"Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?"
1131,Darryl,"Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing.  I banged this girl right here. This is..."
1132,Darryl,"Yes, this is the one."
1133,Darryl,Yes!  Right here. You are a naughty girl!
1134,Michael,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay."
1135,Michael,"Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure."
1136,Pam,"I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks."
1137,Michael,"So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes."
1138,Michael,"Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em."
1139,Michael,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another."
1140,Michael,The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
1141,Michael,"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan."
1142,Michael,"No, I've seen the video."
1143,Michael,"No, I didn't.  Huh, what? "
1144,Michael,"Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things."
1145,Jim,Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
1146,Jim,"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so..."
1147,Michael,THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
1148,Michael,You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
1149,Michael,"Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny."
1150,Michael,I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
1151,Michael,This guy does it all.
1152,Michael,So I'm not in trouble?
1153,Michael,"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems."
1154,Michael,"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so..."
1155,Michael,I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
1156,Pam,I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
1157,Pam,Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
1158,Pam,This is where I used to keep my computer.
1159,Pam,But then I moved it.
1160,Pam,"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So..."
1161,Pam,"So this is like, um, an organization station..."
1162,Pam,"Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time."
1163,Pam,Then we can go to dinner.
1164,Michael,"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line."
1165,Michael,"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin."
1166,Michael,"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother."
1167,Michael,I don't know about that.
1168,Michael,"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner."
1169,Kevin,You mean where my desk is?
1170,Michael,"Yes, your corner. Go."
1171,Kevin,Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
1172,Michael,"They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on."
1173,Michael,"You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody."
1174,Michael,"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to."
1175,Michael,"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast."
1176,Ryan,"I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit."
1177,Michael,"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan."
1178,Ryan,"What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?"
1179,Michael,"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. ""Home Alone,"" ""Risky Business."" Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do."
1180,Ryan,I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
1181,Michael,Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
1182,Michael,"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate."
1183,Michael,"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you."
1184,Dwight,"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers."
1185,Pam,"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him."
1186,Pam,You see Dwight's coffee mug?
1187,Pam,"Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it."
1188,Jim,No way. Let's do this  Oh.
1189,Pam,Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
1190,Michael,Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
1191,Michael,Sign the papers at the condo.
1192,Dwight,You have your lawyer there?
1193,Michael,"Uh, I don't need one."
1194,Dwight,Can I be your representative?
1195,Michael,I don't need a representative.
1196,Dwight,I think I should be there.
1197,Dwight,I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
1198,Michael,No. Dwight. I'm fine.
1199,Dwight,"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work."
1200,Michael,"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal."
1201,Dwight,So you're taking a personal day?
1202,Michael,"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work."
1203,Dwight,"Please, I'll make you proud."
1204,Michael,"Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come."
1205,Dwight,Yes! As your representative?
1206,Michael,No it is not.
1207,Dwight,"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy."
1208,Michael,"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
1209,Michael,We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
1210,Pam,Have a great time.
1211,Michael,"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?"
1212,Pam,"Yeah, I changed them to your new address."
1213,Michael,Good. The Small Business Man?
1214,Michael,Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
1215,Pam,"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription."
1216,Michael,"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?"
1217,Michael,"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you."
1218,Michael,Ok. See you soon.
1219,Dwight,What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
1220,Michael,"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?"
1221,Dwight, I want to put the top down.
1222,Michael,"What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please..."
1223,Dwight,But then no one can see us.
1224,Michael,I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
1225,Dwight,Check it out.  Terminator.
1226,Michael,I do not understand what you spend your money on.
1227,Jim,"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?"
1228,Oscar,"Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know."
1229,Jim, What does 2005 season mean?
1230,Jim,"Wait a minute, what is this?"
1231,Oscar,Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
1232,Kevin,Or when we're bored.
1233,Jim,"Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years."
1234,Kevin,We're bored a lot.
1235,Jim,Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.
1236,Kevin,We call it Hate Ball.
1237,Kevin,Because of how much Angela hates it.
1238,Jim,"Hey, do you guys have any other games?"
1239,Kevin,"Sometimes we play ""Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?"""
1240,Oscar,You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
1241,Michael,"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home."
1242,Jim, So that's what this sound is all day.
1243,Michael,"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something."
1244,Michael,Nice to meet you too.
1245,Dwight,This is smaller than your old place.
1246,Michael,"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um."
1247,Dwight,"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x."
1248,Dwight,"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood."
1249,Michael,Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
1250,Dwight,Let's go check out the master bedroom.
1251,Jim,"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?"
1252,Michael,"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall."
1253,Michael,I'm putting my bed right over here.
1254,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed."
1255,Michael,"Well, then I will get a warrantee."
1256,Dwight,"Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off."
1257,Michael,Well then I won't get a warrantee.
1258,Michael,"So that's the problem, is solved. What?"
1259,Dwight,Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
1260,Jim, This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
1261,Kevin,It smells like cookies.
1262,Jim,"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids."
1263,Pam,"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system."
1264,Angela,I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
1265,Jim,Let the games begin. 
1266,Dwight,What kind of mortgage did you get?
1267,Michael,What? Wha? You said ten.
1268,Dwight,"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies."
1269,Dwight,"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live."
1270,Michael,Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
1271,Dwight,"Well, this is it."
1272,Michael,"Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?"
1273,Dwight,"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
1274,Michael,Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
1275,Dwight,We'll be here waiting for you.
1276,Dwight,"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
1277,Jim,"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?"
1278,Pam,"Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
1279,Pam,"In English, box of paper snowshoe racing."
1280,Jim,"Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton."
1281,Pam,"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens."
1282,Jim,"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?"
1283,Jim,"Yes! Phyllis!  Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk."
1284,Michael,"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't..."
1285,Michael,...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
1286,Michael,Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
1287,Michael,"As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here."
1288,Michael,"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down."
1289,Michael,I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
1290,Michael,I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
1291,Dwight,Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? 
1292,Jim,Here we go. Here we go.
1293,Jim,"Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!"
1294,Jim,Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
1295,Jim,"Thank you, delegate from Iceland."
1296,Jim,Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
1297,Michael,"There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today."
1298,Dwight,You didn't have to...
1299,Michael,"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent."
1300,Michael,"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities."
1301,Dwight,I don't even know what to say.
1302,Michael,"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone."
1303,Dwight,Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
1304,Michael,What the hell is a terrarium?
1305,Dwight,It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
1306,Michael,"Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place."
1307,Dwight,Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
1308,Pam,Are you sure you don't want to play?
1309,Pam,"Come on Angela, don't you have a game?"
1310,Angela,"I have one, yes."
1311,Pam,"Well, let's play, what is it?"
1312,Angela,I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
1313,Jim,"Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis."
1314,Jim,"Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it."
1315,Dwight,"Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?"
1316,Michael,We take separate cars.
1317,Dwight,Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
1318,Michael,Why would we do that?
1319,Dwight,Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
1320,Michael,"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok."
1321,Dwight,"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch."
1322,Jim,Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
1323,Jim,Ryan Howard. Ryan!  Gold medal.
1324,Pam,I made something for our closing ceremonies.
1325,Jim,What?  Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
1326,Jim,"Alright Pam, alright . Nice work!"
1327,Dwight,You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
1328,Michael,"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst."
1329,Michael,"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet."
1330,Dwight,Let's get this roof going.
1331,Jim,Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.
1332,Jim,"Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come.  Guys?"
1333,Dwight,What is going on?
1334,Jim,Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
1335,Jim, Here you go. All done.
1336,Jim,"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so."
1337,Ryan,"I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?"
1338,Pam,I have 59 voicemails.
1339,Jim,"Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?"
1340,Jim,"Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies."
1341,Michael,Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
1342,Jim,Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
1343,Michael,"Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly."
1344,Jim,"Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you."
1345,Jim,"These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.  Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. "
1346,Michael,"I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment."
1347,Jim,"And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal."
1348,Michael,"Get up here, Dwight."
1349,Michael,"Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?"
1350,Jim,Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
1351,Michael,Oh.  What the hell is that?
1352,Jim,Those are the doves.
1353,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second."
1354,Jim,Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
1355,Pam,"Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?"
1356,Jim,So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
1357,Pam, Hey! You can just give her your extension.
1358,Michael,"Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think."
1359,Ryan,The temp agency wants to know what you think.
1360,Michael,"Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! "
1361,Dwight,Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
1362,Michael,"Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?"
1363,Ryan,"Ah, well, I'm interested in business."
1364,Michael,Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
1365,Ryan,"Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company."
1366,Michael,Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
1367,Michael, Much advice you seek.  Do you know who that is?
1368,Michael,Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
1369,Michael,There are ten rules of business that you need to learn. Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
1370,Michael,And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
1371,Dwight,"Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto."
1372,Oscar, But it says no late fee... .
1373,Dwight,This is not a test! Move to the exits!
1374,Dwight,Head towards the exits.
1375,Dwight,Get up off your desks!
1376,Oscar," No, I don't hear it? Alright."
1377,Dwight,"No, panic is warranted!"
1378,Angela,Go in single file lines.
1379,Oscar," No, no. Finish the..."
1380,Dwight,This is not at drill!
1381,Angela,Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
1382,Dwight,"Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!"
1383,Dwight,"This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!"
1384,Dwight,This is not a test! Can you leave?!
1385,Dwight,DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
1386,Dwight,Do you want to die? OUT!!
1387,Angela,"Alright, let's go, let's go."
1388,Dwight,STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
1389,Angela,"Come on, you're safety partners!"
1390,Dwight,Move to the exits!
1391,Dwight,"We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah!  Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!"
1392,Dwight,Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
1393,Dwight,"Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!"
1394,Michael,"Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands."
1395,Michael,Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
1396,Michael,Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.
1397,Dwight,"Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?"
1398,Michael,So what was rule two?
1399,Ryan,"Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act."
1400,Michael,"Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower."
1401,Dwight,"Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off."
1402,Michael,"Okay, uh, well, one is taken."
1403,Dwight,"Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today."
1404,Michael,"Well, he needs a permanent number, right?"
1405,Dwight,"Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers."
1406,Michael,"Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges."
1407,Dwight,"That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers..."
1408,Ryan,"I don't want to be like ""a guy"" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the ""crossword puzzle guy"". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the ""something guy""."
1409,Jim,"Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?"
1410,Jim,Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
1411,Dwight," Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a..."
1412,Jim,"Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela."
1413,Angela,A Purpose Driven Life.
1414,Angela,I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
1415,Dwight,"Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?"
1416,Dwight,"Then I would bring an axe, no books."
1417,Jim,"Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight."
1418,Dwight,Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
1419,Dwight,"...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?"
1420,Michael,"Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?"
1421,Jim,Okay. Thought people read more books.
1422,Jim,DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith?
1423,Pam,Legends of the Fall?
1424,Jim,"Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... ."
1425,Pam,"Well, I kind of liked Legal..."
1426,Jim,"Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable."
1427,Pam,I take it back.
1428,Pam,I take it back!
1429,Dwight,"Is this your car, Ryan?"
1430,Michael,"Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?"
1431,Michael,"Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for..."
1432,Ryan,That's actually a test prep book.
1433,Ryan,That's a test prep for business school.
1434,Michael,"Um, oh, thinking about business school?"
1435,Ryan,"I just got in. I applied, I go at night."
1436,Michael,So you think you know a lot about business?
1437,Ryan,I... wouldn't even know where to start.
1438,Michael,"Come on, egghead. Let's do it."
1439,Ryan,"All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?"
1440,Michael,"When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me."
1441,Ryan,Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
1442,Michael," Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, it's equal."
1443,Ryan,It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
1444,Michael,Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
1445,Dwight,"Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks."
1446,Dwight,Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
1447,Michael,"You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about."
1448,Dwight," Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?"
1449,Michael,"For instance, why don't you go to business..."
1450,Dwight," You should learn from him, right?"
1451,Michael,"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will."
1452,Michael,"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all."
1453,Michael,Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
1454,Ryan,It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
1455,Michael,You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
1456,Jim,Pam? Get us back into it.
1457,Jim,Five movies. Go ahead.
1458,Pam,"Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused..."
1459,Jim,"Ooh, definitely in my top five."
1460,Pam,"Yes. In my top three, so suck it."
1461,Pam,Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
1462,Pam,"No, my all time favorite!"
1463,Jim,"Pam, play by the rules."
1464,Jim,Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
1465,Michael,"I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?"
1466,Ryan,Maybe we should get some air.
1467,Jim,All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
1468,Jim,"Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then..."
1469,Jim,"Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back."
1470,Jim,Come on Dwight! Use words.
1471,Dwight,Why didn't I go to business school?
1472,Jim,Who goes to business school?
1473,Dwight,"Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore."
1474,Pam,"You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'."
1475,Dwight,He doesn't even know that I do that.
1476,Pam,You should tell him.
1477,Dwight,"Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted."
1478,Dwight,"I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway."
1479,Jim,"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them."
1480,Dwight,"Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins."
1481,Dwight,Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
1482,Michael,"Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?"
1483,Michael,"Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?"
1484,Angela,My name is Angela.
1485,Michael,"Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?"
1486,Jim,"Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling."
1487,Michael,"Well, I would definitely have s*x with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business."
1488,Michael,"Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo..."
1489,Ryan," Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk... this is great timing."
1490,Michael,"Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So..."
1491,Dwight,Would that make you happy?
1492,Dwight,"If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?"
1493,Angela,You can't go in yet!
1494,Michael,"Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen."
1495,Kevin,What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
1496,Michael,I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
1497,Pam,Um... Oscar's kind of cute.
1498,Michael, How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
1499,Jim," Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs..."
1500,Michael,"Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find."
1501,Michael,I gave it to you in the car.
1502,Michael,I saw you program it in.
1503,Ryan,You got to... you got to give it to me again.
1504,Ryan,Now I have it.
1505,Michael,"Uh, I better tell somebody.  Excuse me, sir..."
1506,Michael,"Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh."
1507,Dwight," Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing."
1508,Michael,"Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school."
1509,Dwight,That's exactly what I said.
1510,Michael,"Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?"
1511,Ryan,I am so sorry.
1512,Michael,"Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans."
1513,Dwight,"I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready?  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!"
1514,Michael, ...since the world was turning.
1515,Ryan,I can't believe I started the fire.
1516,Dwight,Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
1517,Jim,"Good, how are you?"
1518,Jim,"Good to see you, too."
1519,Jim,"Yeah, I am too."
1520,Jim,"Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on.  Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite.  Desert Island. Five movies. Go."
1521,Pam,"I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car."
1522,Jim,"Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?"
1523,Ryan,"I'm really sorry, Dwight."
1524,Dwight,"Answer me this, though."
1525,Dwight,Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
1526,Kevin,Was it worth it?
1527,Ryan,"I'm really sorry, Dwight."
1528,Dwight,The fire guy! The fire guy!
1529,Dwight," Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!"
1530,Michael,"Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer."
1531,Michael,Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
1532,Michael,I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
1533,Michael,"Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... that's great!"
1534,Pam,Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
1535,Michael,"I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay."
1536,Michael,"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning."
1537,Michael,"Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day."
1538,Michael,I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
1539,Michael,"If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?"
1540,Michael,I'll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
1541,Michael,"I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about."
1542,Michael,"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do."
1543,Pam,Why did you put it off until Halloween?
1544,Michael,Because it's very scary stuff.
1545,Pam,I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
1546,Michael,You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
1547,Pam,So it's a man?
1548,Michael,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?"
1549,Pam,I just answer the phone.
1550,Michael,And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
1551,Pam,You're costume is fantastic! 
1552,Michael,I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. 
1553,Pam,"Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Aah!  Okay..."
1554,Michael,"Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody."
1555,Dwight, What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
1556,Jim,"I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch."
1557,Dwight,"Yeah, well look...  What about me?"
1558,Dwight,I am a Sith Lord.  Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
1559,Michael,You guys excited about the party?
1560,Michael,It's gonna be fun.
1561,Michael," Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day."
1562,Oscar,What are you implying?
1563,Michael,All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
1564,Angela,"You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night."
1565,Michael,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?"
1566,Michael,"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers."
1567,Angela,But we don't keep two sets of books.
1568,Michael,"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it."
1569,Michael,"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats."
1570,Michael,"""Bend It Like Beckham."""
1571,Michael, Yeah. That would be perfect.
1572,Michael,"Well, I don't really have two heads. So..."
1573,Dwight,"Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! "
1574,Pam,A dog-like obedience to authority
1575,Pam,But that doesn't sound good.
1576,Jim,"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? "
1577,Jim,"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India."
1578,Pam,He's a gun nut.
1579,Jim,Um. He sticks to his guns.
1580,Angela,"Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department..."
1581,Angela,... that has three people...
1582,Angela,... doing the work that could be done by two.
1583,Oscar,This is great.  Oh.
1584,Michael,Who do you think it should be?
1585,Michael,"No, Jim brings in money."
1586,Dwight,Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
1587,Michael,It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
1588,Dwight,One of the warehouse guys.
1589,Michael, What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
1590,Dwight,Who is he saying?
1591,Michael,"You're right, I didn't even think of him."
1592,Michael,"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea."
1593,Michael,I'm not saying that's what he said.
1594,Dwight,I know that's what he said.
1595,Dwight,"Tell him, not Dwight."
1596,Michael,That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
1597,Dwight,Tell him to stop.
1598,Michael,I agree. He'd land on his feet.
1599,Dwight,Make him be quiet.
1600,Angela,Those aren't chips and dip.
1601,Pam,"No, I made brownies."
1602,Angela,I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
1603,Angela,And I made cookies. Same category.
1604,Pam,I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
1605,Pam," Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.  Uh, yeah.  Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott."
1606,Jim,"Um... Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay."
1607,Dwight,"Stanley, could you come with me, please."
1608,Dwight,As Assistant Regional Manager...
1609,Dwight,"Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go.  I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry."
1610,Michael,So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
1611,Dwight,He wouldn't listen to me
1612,Dwight,"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself."
1613,Michael,"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... "
1614,Dwight," Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?"
1615,Dwight,"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most."
1616,Ryan,"Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just..."
1617,Dwight," So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... "
1618,Pam,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real."
1619,Pam,"Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job."
1620,Jim,Um... it's in Maryland.
1621,Pam,"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge."
1622,Jim,Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. 
1623,Dwight,"This is called leveraging an offer.  Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?"
1624,Dwight,"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills."
1625,Dwight,And I turned it down.
1626,Michael,What?! That would've solved all my problems.
1627,Dwight,Out of loyalty to this company...
1628,Dwight,... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
1629,Michael,"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody."
1630,Dwight,But then you wouldn't have me here.
1631,Michael,"Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?"
1632,Michael,You can call. Can you call 'em?
1633,Dwight,I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
1634,Michael,Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
1635,Jim,"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma."
1636,Michael, Can I speak to you a minute?
1637,Jim,"Michael, I really didn't mean to..."
1638,Michael,"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it."
1639,Jim,"Oh, you want me to be you?"
1640,Michael,"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed."
1641,Jim,"Oh, are you firing Creed?"
1642,Michael,"No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head."
1643,Jim,We should switch seats in order to...
1644,Michael,"Yes, that's a good idea."
1645,Jim,"Alright.  Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal..."
1646,Michael,Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
1647,Michael,"I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!"
1648,Michael,Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
1649,Jim,"Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you..."
1650,Michael,I... this is Creed.
1651,Michael,"I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. "
1652,Jim,"Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought."
1653,Michael,"And I'm very angry, and I want..."
1654,Michael,I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
1655,Jim,"Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth..."
1656,Michael,"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah."
1657,Pam,Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
1658,Michael,Could I talk to you for a second?
1659,Michael,"You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop."
1660,Michael,I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
1661,Michael,"No, you wanna leave."
1662,Michael,Why... why are you making this so hard?
1663,Michael,I think you're right.
1664,Michael,"No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye."
1665,Michael,What old days? What are you talking about?
1666,Michael,"It's right here on the desk, yeah."
1667,Michael,"I can't, I can't..."
1668,Michael,I can't change anything. This is the way...
1669,Michael,"I don't... okay, just listen."
1670,Michael,"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?"
1671,Michael,"I have to fire someone today, okay?"
1672,Michael,"Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you."
1673,Michael,"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?"
1674,Michael,"Well, maybe I did."
1675,Michael,"Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot."
1676,Michael,"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and..."
1677,Michael,I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
1678,Michael,"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings."
1679,Angela, What about the Halloween party?
1680,Pam,"Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out."
1681,Jim,"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food."
1682,Michael,"I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year."
1683,Michael,"He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great."
1684,Michael,You look great! And you're a princess?
1685,Michael,A fairy princess. You're very... .
1686,Michael,"You're a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh!  Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these."
1687,Dwight,Where is my desk?
1688,Dwight,This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.
1689,Jim,"Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk."
1690,Dwight,I didn't lose my desk.
1691,Jim,"Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it?"
1692,Dwight,"Okay, who moved my desk?"
1693,Jim,I think you should retrace your steps.
1694,Dwight,"Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!"
1695,Jim,"Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot."
1696,Jim," Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model."
1697,Dwight,"Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times."
1698,Dwight,It's by the ream?
1699,Dwight,"...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%."
1700,Jim,"Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work."
1701,Dwight,"Wash your hands, Kevin."
1702,Jim," Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second..."
1703,Dwight," Sensei, hello it's Sempai..."
1704,Jim,"You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks."
1705,Dwight,"Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai."
1706,Jim,Was that your mom?
1707,Dwight,"No, that was my Sensei."
1708,Jim,"Oh, I thought it was your mom."
1709,Dwight,"I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei."
1710,Jim,"Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool."
1711,Dwight,"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei."
1712,Pam,I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
1713,Pam,"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm."
1714,Michael," I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day."
1715,Ryan,Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
1716,Michael,"Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information."
1717,Ryan,Why is that secret? 
1718,Michael," Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin."
1719,Pam,"Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign."
1720,Michael,"Yes, thank you. I know where to sign."
1721,Pam,It's just last year you...
1722,Michael,"Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?"
1723,Pam,"Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier."
1724,Michael,"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is."
1725,Pam,"Well, is that really a priority?"
1726,Michael,"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. ""Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority."" Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you."
1727,Michael,"Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?"
1728,Jim,117 Mount Bergin St.
1729,Michael, Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
1730,Ryan,Do you mean Neverland?
1731,Pam, You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
1732,Jim,"You making this up as you go along, aren't you?"
1733,Pam,I am just following the website.
1734,Jim,"Well, at least I don't have cavities."
1735,Pam,"Yes, you have very nice teeth."
1736,Ryan,Who is your emergency contact? 
1737,Michael, This is Mike Tyson.
1738,Jim,"Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?"
1739,Dwight,Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
1740,Dwight,"Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you."
1741,Jim,"Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. "
1742,Dwight,"Ok, give that back to me."
1743,Dwight,No. That is not a toy.
1744,Jim,"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou."
1745,Dwight,Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
1746,Michael,"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man."
1747,Pam,Could you practice on the forms?
1748,Dwight,"No women or children, unless provoked."
1749,Dwight,Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
1750,Jim,Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
1751,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen."
1752,Michael,Because I would kick his ass.
1753,Jim,"Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so..."
1754,Michael,So? I've beaten up black belts.
1755,Jim,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?"
1756,Michael,"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out."
1757,Ryan,Is your wife still your contact?
1758,Michael,"And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again."
1759,Jim,"Sounds tough. When you're a Jet,  you're a Jet all the way, right?"
1760,Michael,You were a Jet?
1761,Angela,Have you signed the expense reports yet?
1762,Michael,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link."
1763,Michael,"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up."
1764,Michael,Just hit me. You'll see.
1765,Jim,I can't. I just got a manicure.
1766,Michael,"Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it."
1767,Jim,Just have Dwight punch you.
1768,Michael,"Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass."
1769,Jim,You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
1770,Dwight,What belt are they?
1771,Michael,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'..."
1772,Michael,... he cried at the end of it. He did.
1773,Dwight,"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight."
1774,Michael,"Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?"
1775,Dwight,"Ok, I'll punch you."
1776,Michael,"Ok, here we go. Alright, come on."
1777,Dwight,"Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not."
1778,Jim,Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
1779,Dwight,I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
1780,Jim,"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael."
1781,Jim,"Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips."
1782,Dwight, Take this pen and stab me with it.
1783,Pam,I just have a quick question.
1784,Michael,"I haven't signed them, ok?"
1785,Pam,"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?"
1786,Michael,"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough."
1787,Pam,He's a purple belt. That's really high.
1788,Michael,"Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him."
1789,Pam,"It's just out there, you..."
1790,Michael,"Oh, so that's what they are saying?"
1791,Michael,"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?"
1792,Dwight,"Now watch, let me take you from behind."
1793,Michael,"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you."
1794,Dwight,"I didn't sucker punch you, Michael."
1795,Dwight,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai."
1796,Michael,"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22."
1797,Dwight,"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!"
1798,Michael,"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor."
1799,Dwight,"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective."
1800,Michael,You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
1801,Jim,"Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo?"
1802,Michael,"No, they must have class."
1803,Dwight,"No, it's free during the day. It's fine."
1804,Dwight,I've got the key.
1805,Michael,"I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools."
1806,Jim,"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight..."
1807,Michael,I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
1808,Michael,I think it is. A guy told me about that.
1809,Jim," Wow, that is really interesting."
1810,Jim,Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
1811,Pam,Once point for me.
1812,Jim,"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now."
1813,Pam,"Hey, put me down. Put me down.  Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey..."
1814,Michael,"Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner."
1815,Michael,What the hell was that?
1816,Michael,"Alright, that's the way you want it."
1817,Michael,"Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man."
1818,Michael,"I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him."
1819,Michael,I got his pants.
1820,Dwight,It was my pants.
1821,Michael,"Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! "
1822,Michael,"Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya."
1823,Michael,"You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points. "
1824,Dwight,"No, stop it! Come on! Michael."
1825,Michael,"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? ""Raging Bull."" Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious.  Oh, we're playing phone tag."
1826,Michael,My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
1827,Michael," Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?"
1828,Dwight,I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
1829,Dwight,"Just put ""The Hospital."" Contact number: just put 9-1-1. "
1830,Michael,"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man."
1831,Jim,"Later, Kev.  Have a good weekend."
1832,Ryan,I have the emergency contacts.
1833,Michael,"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?"
1834,Ryan,"Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably."
1835,Michael,"If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout."
1836,Ryan,"Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday."
1837,Angela,"Michael, did you finish yet?"
1838,Michael,"This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?"
1839,Michael,"Well,  busier. Making the time."
1840,Michael,"Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby."
1841,Pam,The shipping place closes in a half hour.
1842,Michael,"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight."
1843,Michael,I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
1844,Michael,And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
1845,Dwight,"Michael, I don't know..."
1846,Michael,"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it."
1847,Dwight,I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
1848,Michael,"No, no, title change only."
1849,Dwight,I'll have Pam send out a memo.
1850,Michael,"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now."
1851,Michael,Absolutely but not really.
1852,Dwight,"Michael, I have so much to learn from you."
1853,Michael,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo."
1854,Ryan," Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie."
1855,Jim,No. They're in the conference room.
1856,Pam,"Wait, are those Michael's Levis?"
1857,Ryan,"Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?"
1858,Pam,"Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays."
1859,Pam, I'll take those. Thanks. 
1860,Michael,"Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today."
1861,Jim,"So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years.  Years."
1862,Michael,I changed it. To Chili's.
1863,Michael,"Radisson just gives out this vibe, ""Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson"". It's kind of snooty. So."
1864,Michael,Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
1865,Michael,It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.
1866,Michael,"Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip."
1867,Oscar,"She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out."
1868,Oscar,"Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner."
1869,Pam,What is going on?
1870,Jim,We are doing worst first dates.
1871,Pam,"Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me."
1872,Oscar,"Ok, that's a joke."
1873,Pam,"No, they had to come back for me."
1874,Jim,"Wait, when was this?"
1875,Pam,Umm... it was not that long ago.
1876,Jim,"I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting."
1877,Michael,"Ok, let's do this thing.  Wish us luck."
1878,Dwight,"Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan."
1879,Michael," Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now."
1880,Michael,"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.  Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao.  Adios!"
1881,Michael,"It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?"
1882,Michael,"You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-"
1883,Michael,"Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead."
1884,Michael,We should come up with a signal of some sort.
1885,Michael,"Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-"
1886,Michael,"Well, I... it could be either of us."
1887,Michael,Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
1888,Michael,"Uh, Jan, what happened?"
1889,Michael,Is Gould dead? What uh-
1890,Michael,"Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?"
1891,Michael,When did this happen?
1892,Michael," I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?"
1893,Michael,"Ok, it's done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done."
1894,Michael,Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?
1895,Michael,"Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo."
1896,Pam,"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."
1897,Michael,"Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me."
1898,Pam," Ok, you want me to read 'em?"
1899,Pam,"Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-"
1900,Michael,Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.
1901,Pam,Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship-
1902,Michael,"Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?"
1903,Pam,Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
1904,Pam,It is a screenplay. Starring himself.
1905,Jim,"How long is this?  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings."
1906,Jim,"Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like."
1907,Michael,"First guy says ""Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn"". And the second guy says, ""Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort"". And the third guy says ""I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe""."
1908,Jim,"Do we all have our copy of ""Threat Level: Midnight"", by Michael Scott?"
1909,Jim,"Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones."
1910,Dwight,"Ok, you guys should not be doing this."
1911,Jim,"Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy."
1912,Dwight,You took something that doesn't belong to you.
1913,Dwight,Brought it in here-
1914,Jim,Do you want to play-
1915,Dwight,Made copies of it-
1916,Jim,The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
1917,Michael, Yum! Yum yum yum!  That's delicious! I love it!
1918,Michael,"Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop."
1919,Michael,"That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault."
1920,Michael,"Did somebody say ""baby back ribs""? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?"
1921,Michael," I want my baby back, baby back, baby back "
1922,Michael, Chili's baby back ribs...
1923,Jim," Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters."
1924,Dwight,"Ok, what are they?"
1925,Dwight,"Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!"
1926,Dwight,"Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of ""Oklahoma"" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good."
1927,Dwight,"If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang."
1928,Ryan,"Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight."
1929,Dwight,Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission. 
1930,Pam,"Hey, uh, I have to work late."
1931,Jim,Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
1932,Ryan,"Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word."
1933,Kevin,Michael's movie? Two thumbs down.  Heh.
1934,Jim,"A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn.  Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?"
1935,Oscar,"Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?"
1936,Dwight,"Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage."
1937,Ryan,"I forget it, brutha."
1938,Dwight,"Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt.  Wait, who's Dwigt?"
1939,Pam,"Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops."
1940,Dwight,"Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end."
1941,Jim,"Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-"
1942,Dwight,"Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now."
1943,Jim,"That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission.  Hey, are you hungry?"
1944,Michael,"Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh."
1945,Michael,"Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing."
1946,Michael,She's not playing the game.
1947,Michael,"No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?"
1948,Jim,"I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer."
1949,Jim,"Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich."
1950,Pam,Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
1951,Michael,"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices."
1952,Michael,"It, you know what, it really is."
1953,Michael,"Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?"
1954,Jim,"So, I guess I'll see you in  ten hours."
1955,Pam,What are you going to do with your time off?
1956,Jim,Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself.
1957,Pam, You have new music?
1958,Michael,Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.
1959,Michael,Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go.  Oh-ok.
1960,Dwight, Michael? Michael?  Michael?  His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports.  Who's this? Jan?
1961,Michael,"No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So."
1962,Dwight,Did you do her?
1963,Michael,"Uh, no, no, no Gould."
1964,Dwight,Did you do her?
1965,Michael,This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
1966,Dwight,And she is your boss.
1967,Michael,"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.  Jan, I defend your honor.  Is that all?"
1968,Jim,Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
1969,Jim,Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
1970,Pam,"Oh, I don't know...  Oh my God. This is Jan's cell."
1971,Pam,"Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."
1972,Michael,"I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question: do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh,  Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No.  Would you excuse me?  No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no.  This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk  Excuse me? Excuse me?!  I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!"
1973,Jim,Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
1974,Pam,Why might some say that?
1975,Jim,"Cause there was dinner, by candlelight."
1976,Jim,"Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie.  And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date."
1977,Jim,"You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic."
1978,Jim,Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
1979,Pam,I have some faxes to get out.
1980,Jim,"Oh, come on, Pam. I-"
1981,Jim,"Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?"
1982,Dwight, You should get one of these.
1983,Dwight,Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
1984,Dwight,This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.  Sorry.
1985,Dwight,"Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x."
1986,Jim,You're not having s*x.
1987,Dwight,"Plus, improves your reflexes  see, I would have caught that."
1988,Jim,"Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?"
1989,Dwight,It's only twenty-five bucks.
1990,Michael,"Pam, could I see you in my office?"
1991,Pam,"It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect."
1992,Michael,"And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."" First impressions?"
1993,Pam,"Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon."
1994,Michael,"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual."
1995,Michael," ""I guess I missed you."" I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?"
1996,Michael,"But then she goes on to say ""that will be our only topic of discussion"". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words."
1997,Pam,I have one idea of what it means.
1998,Michael,"Ok. Yeah, what, what?"
1999,Pam,Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
2000,Michael,"Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-"
2001,Pam,"Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you."
2002,Michael,"Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?"
2003,Pam,"Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward."
2004,Michael,"Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again.  ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you""."
2005,Dwight,"Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review."
2006,Dwight,Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
2007,Jim,We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
2008,Dwight,"Oh, yes, we do."
2009,Dwight,"Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise."
2010,Jim,"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease."
2011,Dwight,"Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?"
2012,Dwight,"Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid."
2013,Jim,"Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?"
2014,Jim,Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
2015,Michael,"God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry."
2016,Pam,Michael and Jan definitely made out.
2017,Jim,"Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'."
2018,Michael,"Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn."
2019,Angela,I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
2020,Pam,Jan's on the phone for you.
2021,Michael,"Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year."
2022,Michael,Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.  Yeah?
2023,Michael,Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?
2024,Michael,"Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's."
2025,Michael,"Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's."
2026,Michael,Been thinking about you.
2027,Michael,"Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-"
2028,Michael,"They are not. Yes, they are.  That's my girlfriend."
2029,Kevin,I heard they made out and had s*x.
2030,Oscar,"No, they just made out. That's it."
2031,Angela,Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
2032,Michael,"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A ""Michael-idea"" folder?"
2033,Michael,That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.
2034,Michael,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?"
2035,Pam,"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started."
2036,Michael,"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p."
2037,Ryan,Don't you mean constructive criticism?
2038,Michael,What did I say?
2039,Michael,"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?"
2040,Jim," Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a..."
2041,Jim," ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon."
2042,Michael,"Hi, Jan. How are you?"
2043,Michael,Good to see you.
2044,Michael,"Ok.  Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here."
2045,Michael,"Yep, right after you. Apres-vous.  No calls."
2046,Michael,It's nice to see you.
2047,Michael,"I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because ""Oh, I regret that."" But, ""Wait, I'm still gonna call you."" But, but, ""We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job."" But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business."
2048,Michael,"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual.  We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?"
2049,Michael,"This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise."
2050,Michael,Are you wearing a new perfume today?
2051,Michael,"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And  it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy."
2052,Jim,"Hey, how's it goin'?"
2053,Pam,"Oh my God, did you see ""The Apprentice"" last night?"
2054,Jim,"Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?"
2055,Pam,Can you believe who Trump fired?
2056,Jim,"No, that was unbelievable."
2057,Dwight,Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?
2058,Pam,You didn't see it?
2059,Dwight,"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?"
2060,Michael,"I don't understand-  Hold on. Sorry.  Yes, Pam."
2061,Pam,"Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting."
2062,Michael,I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
2063,Pam,You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
2064,Michael,"I did not, not, not use those words."
2065,Michael,"No, it's in like ten minutes."
2066,Pam,Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
2067,Michael,"Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one: ""What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"""
2068,Dwight,What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
2069,Michael,"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally."
2070,Michael,"And, um, one down. Next suggestion: ""we need better outreach for employees fighting depression"". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression."
2071,Michael,"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?"
2072,Michael,Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
2073,Michael,"Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion."
2074,Michael,"Arrr, dooby dooby do. ""You need to do something about your B.O."""
2075,Dwight,You need to do something about your B.O.
2076,Michael,"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody."
2077,Michael,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words."
2078,Michael,"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. ""You need to do something about your coffee breath""-"
2079,Dwight,To do something about-
2080,Michael,"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box."
2081,Angela,Sometimes you talk to us real close.
2082,Michael,"Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-"
2083,Angela,"Well, when you have coffee breath-"
2084,Michael,I'll work on that-
2085,Michael,"Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow."
2086,Dwight,"Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?"
2087,Michael,"Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion."
2088,Michael,"""Don't sl-"", ok, that's blank  Don't, just put it-"
2089,Dwight,"""Don't sleep with your boss""? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?"
2090,Michael,I don't understand why you're so upset.
2091,Michael,Let me ask you-
2092,Michael,"Ok, let me ask you this."
2093,Michael,Let me ask you something.
2094,Michael,Where did you get your outfit?
2095,Dwight, You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise!  Yes!  Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
2096,Michael,I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
2097,Dwight,"I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out?"
2098,Michael,What do you want Dwight?
2099,Dwight,I am ready for my performance review.
2100,Michael,"Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye."
2101,Michael,"You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave."
2102,Dwight,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?"
2103,Michael,Why on earth would we give you a raise?
2104,Dwight,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word: dedication.  I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness.  Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays."
2105,Michael,You do? How do you get in?
2106,Dwight,I have a copy of your key.
2107,Michael,That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.
2108,Dwight,I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
2109,Michael,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?"
2110,Dwight,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office."
2111,Michael,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!"
2112,Dwight,"Jan, have you ever had deer?"
2113,Dwight,"It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise."
2114,Michael,"What do you say, Jan?"
2115,Michael,"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head."
2116,Dwight,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said ""Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of""."
2117,Dwight,"Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise."
2118,Pam,Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
2119,Jim,"I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam."
2120,Pam,How do you come back from that?
2121,Jim,"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together."
2122,Pam,"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?"
2123,Pam,As a human being.
2124,Jim,"Yeah, no, I don't think you can."
2125,Michael,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?"
2126,Michael,"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?"
2127,Michael,"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?"
2128,Michael,"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?"
2129,Michael,Am I too short?
2130,Michael,"I appreciate that, thank you."
2131,Michael,"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-"
2132,Michael,So my looks have nothing to do with it?
2133,Michael,Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed
2134,Michael,"Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?"
2135,Michael,"Never missed a day, my ass."
2136,Dwight, I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
2137,Michael,"It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Oh my God. Ohhh.  Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here."
2138,Jim,Are we in danger?
2139,Michael,"There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody. "
2140,Kevin,"Michael, should I call the...  What?"
2141,Michael,The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
2142,Michael,"Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected..."
2143,Michael,Please don't do that.
2144,Dwight,"Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?"
2145,Michael,I can't tell you.
2146,Dwight,You have to tell me.
2147,Michael,I don't have to tell you anything.
2148,Dwight,"Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over."
2149,Michael,"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this.  Brrr! That's strong!"
2150,Dwight,"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-"
2151,Michael,I'm not going get a brain-
2152,Dwight,Or get hit by a car-
2153,Dwight,"Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke."
2154,Michael,"Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away?"
2155,Michael,"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails."
2156,Michael,So how do you search?
2157,Michael,"Try ""profits"". No! Try ""Michael Scott"". ""Michael"" ""boss"" and ""funny"".  Oh my God, wow!  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy.  ""Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late."" Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers."
2158,Oscar,"Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers?"
2159,Michael,"Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot?  I will destroy everything in my path-"
2160,Michael,Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  Oil can. Oil can.
2161,Oscar,Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
2162,Michael,"Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose."
2163,Dwight,So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?
2164,Michael,You know what the problem is?
2165,Michael,"The problem is that when people hear the term ""big brother"", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother."
2166,Kevin,I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.
2167,Dwight,"Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately."
2168,Pam, Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
2169,Pam,Do you think that they're like-
2170,Pam,"No, right, no, no."
2171,Pam,"Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?"
2172,Pam,It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo...  If you guys see anything... ?
2173,Pam,"Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with."
2174,Pam,"One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?"
2175,Dwight,Does he have access to their medical records?
2176,Dwight,"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory."
2177,Michael,"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No."
2178,Pam,"Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?"
2179,Angela,No. Are we supposed to?
2180,Pam,"No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so."
2181,Michael,"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler."
2182,Kevin, Are you gonna eat with us?
2183,Michael,"Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup."
2184,Michael,"Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors."
2185,Pam,The professors would go to the parties?
2186,Michael,Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.
2187,Jim,"It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  He is very real."
2188,Pam, What?  Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!
2189,Dwight,Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
2190,Jim,"Oh, uh, no. Could-"
2191,Jim,"Could, keep that down."
2192,Jim,Because not everybody knows about the party.
2193,Dwight,Like who? Who doesn't know?
2194,Jim,Because it's a surprise.
2195,Jim,"So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael."
2196,Pam,Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
2197,Jim," Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or..."
2198,Pam,"Oh, no, he can't make it."
2199,Jim,"Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock."
2200,Michael,"One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out."
2201,Jim,"Oh, um... .I can't."
2202,Michael,"I do, too. I do, too."
2203,Michael,"I do, yeah. Big plans."
2204,Jim,"Because you said ""do you wanna hang out""-"
2205,Michael,"Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-"
2206,Jim,"Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun."
2207,Michael,"It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go."
2208,Jim,I think Stanley just coughed.
2209,Michael,"Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?"
2210,Michael,"Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with-"
2211,Oscar,I'm on a call.
2212,Michael,"Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?"
2213,Kevin,My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
2214,Michael,"Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to?"
2215,Angela,I'm just leaving for the day.
2216,Michael,"Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed?"
2217,Michael,You are a liar.
2218,Michael,"Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy."
2219,Michael,"That's, whatever stupid show you want-"
2220,Dwight,"Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice."
2221,Michael,"I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight."
2222,Dwight,"Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday.  He has no idea!"
2223,Jim,"Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy."
2224,Dwight,"Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?"
2225,Dwight,You don't work with us.
2226,Jim,That's because Mark's my roommate.
2227,Dwight,"Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here."
2228,Dwight,When is the guest of honor coming?
2229,Dwight,He's gonna love it!
2230,Jim,Great.  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
2231,Jim,Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
2232,Jim,"Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to."
2233,Ryan,"Hey, is Katy coming?"
2234,Jim,"Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while."
2235,Ryan,"Huh, is it ok if I call her?"
2236,Jim,We can talk about that later.
2237,Michael," Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air."
2238,Michael, Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI.
2239,Michael,"Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life? Somebody has a gun.  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't."
2240,Michael,"Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI. You know what you did. Boom! Boom! Boom!  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't ya!? Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds. I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  Boom! Boom! Boom!"
2241,Michael,"Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going."
2242,Jim,"See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's-"
2243,Pam,Cool... This is your desk.
2244,Jim,This is my desk.
2245,Jim,"My home office, this is it."
2246,Pam,Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
2247,Jim,"Ok, sure. Will do."
2248,Pam,"Ok, wait, so that would make me  like right here."
2249,Jim,"Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right."
2250,Pam,And Dwight would be like-
2251,Jim,"You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts."
2252,Jim,"Yeah, you don't have to, ummm. Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all."
2253,Pam,You were so dorky!
2254,Michael,"No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune."
2255,Michael,"Good, it's good. Good work, everybody."
2256,Jim,"Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun?"
2257,Angela,I got sap on me.
2258,Jim,"Chicken, hot dog, burger."
2259,Jim,There is soda inside.
2260,Oscar,"Yeah, it surprised us all. I'll tell you why. Because when they---"
2261,Angela,I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. 
2262,Pam,"Hey Phyllis, come here for a second."
2263,Pam,Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
2264,Pam,That's ok. It's ok.
2265,Kevin, Not so fast... Fire Guy.
2266,Michael,"So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's?  Go to Bernie's?"
2267,Michael,"Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it."
2268,Michael,"Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not."
2269,Jim,Oh by the way how's your side project going?
2270,Pam,"Oh, yeah I gave that up."
2271,Pam,"Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws."
2272,Pam,"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on."
2273,Kevin," Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore."
2274,Michael,"Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine?"
2275,Michael,"Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please.  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---"
2276,Michael,"Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says ""Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.""  And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer."
2277,Dwight,Go. Get the door.
2278,Michael,"No, no, turn it around."
2279,Dwight,Shove it through! Break it!
2280,Michael,"You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight."
2281,Dwight,I got a splinter.
2282,Michael,"Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?"
2283,Dwight,I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
2284,Michael,"On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three."
2285,Kevin," Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?"
2286,Michael,"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year."
2287,Kevin,But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
2288,Michael,"Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about."
2289,Jim,"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel."
2290,Angela,"Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?"
2291,Ryan,Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
2292,Michael," Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?"
2293,Michael,Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
2294,Michael,"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that."
2295,Michael,"I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive."
2296,Pam,You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
2297,Michael,"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody."
2298,Dwight,You guys should use a hand truck.
2299,Kevin,Do we have one?
2300,Angela, Will you help me?
2301,Michael,No! No way! It... no.
2302,Darryl,"Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours."
2303,Michael,You wanna be Santa?
2304,Michael,Have you ever seen Santa?
2305,Darryl,"Yeah, I've seen Santa."
2306,Michael,"Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work."
2307,Dwight,"Michael, I would like to be the elf."
2308,Michael,That makes sense because he has elfish features.
2309,Dwight," Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael."
2310,Oscar,"I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain."
2311,Kevin,"I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't ."
2312,Michael,You get something good this year?
2313,Jim,I think I did a pretty good job.
2314,Michael,Yeah? Who did you have?
2315,Jim,"Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret."
2316,Michael,I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
2317,Michael,I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
2318,Jim,"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?"
2319,Michael,Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
2320,Jim,"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .."
2321,Michael,It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
2322,Dwight,"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons."
2323,Dwight,I want to do it.
2324,Michael,"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?"
2325,Pam,I think the tree looks nice.
2326,Dwight,"Hey, I could get some flares from my car."
2327,Michael,"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa."
2328,Michael,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, ""Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."""
2329,Oscar,"Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .."
2330,Dwight,Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
2331,Jim,Great. Where did you get it?
2332,Jim,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag."
2333,Pam," Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome."
2334,Jim,There's a little more to it.
2335,Dwight,"All right, next. Ryan. "
2336,Ryan," Whoa, a video iPod."
2337,Michael,"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away."
2338,Ryan,Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
2339,Michael,You don't know that.
2340,Ryan,"Yeah, you left the price tag on."
2341,Michael,"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?"
2342,Michael,"Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on."
2343,Michael,An oven mitt? Okay. 
2344,Michael,"So Phyllis is basically saying, ""Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth."" I gave Ryan an iPod."
2345,Kevin,Should we just keep opening up the presents?
2346,Dwight,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
2347,Michael,I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
2348,Jim,What is Yankee Swap?
2349,Michael,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift."
2350,Jim,I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
2351,Pam,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant."
2352,Michael,"Well, I call it fun!"
2353,Oscar,Why are we doing this?
2354,Michael,Because it's better. Because it's more special.
2355,Michael,"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot."
2356,Angela,Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. 
2357,Michael,"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt."
2358,Jim,"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam."
2359,Michael,"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now."
2360,Pam,I'll take the iPod.
2361,Ryan,And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
2362,Dwight,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift."
2363,Michael,I think this is going great.
2364,Angela,I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
2365,Michael,Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
2366,Michael,"Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn."
2367,Oscar,I'll take the ... teapot.
2368,Dwight,"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go."
2369,Dwight,It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
2370,Michael," I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful."
2371,Michael,"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology."
2372,Michael,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm."
2373,Michael," ""In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."""
2374,Dwight,"You and me, Michael. Yes!"
2375,Michael,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
2376,Dwight,I never said it was better than an iPod.
2377,Dwight,"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand."
2378,Kevin,I want the foot bath.
2379,Kevin,"That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it.  Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot."
2380,Dwight,"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift."
2381,Pam,I want the iPod.
2382,Jim,Sure you don't want the teapot?
2383,Pam,"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But .."
2384,Jim,No. No. Definitely. It's ..
2385,Dwight,Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
2386,Jim,Got to be kidding me.
2387,Dwight,Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
2388,Michael, What is she so upset about?
2389,Pam,Maybe because you hated her present so much.
2390,Michael,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
2391,Jim,"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people."
2392,Michael,"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!"
2393,Oscar,You got a bonus check?
2394,Michael,"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000."
2395,Michael,"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame."
2396,Michael,"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?"
2397,Michael,"Cool, cool. Box it up."
2398,Jim,"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?"
2399,Jim,"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck."
2400,Jim,"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?"
2401,Dwight,No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
2402,Jim,You don't even drink tea.
2403,Dwight,"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .."
2404,Dwight,".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. "
2405,Jim,"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle."
2406,Pam,I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
2407,Pam,So what are you going to get me instead?
2408,Michael,Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
2409,Michael,"This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze."
2410,Michael,"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?"
2411,Michael,"Go, here we go!"
2412,Ryan,"What line of work you in, Bob?"
2413,Darryl,"Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done."
2414,Darryl,I had to. I needed defense.
2415,Darryl,It is worth it.
2416,Darryl,Are you kidding? You wait.
2417,Michael,"Anybody making out in here?  Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.  Okay, how's it going in here? "
2418,Ryan,We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
2419,Angela,There should be some ..
2420,Michael,"No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party."
2421,Michael,"Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee."
2422,Ryan,I really did not do anything.
2423,Michael,"Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend."
2424,Jim,"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know."
2425,Pam," No, I was just checking out my present. "
2426,Pam,"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .."
2427,Jim,"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside."
2428,Pam, Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
2429,Pam,"Yeah, I think I made the right choice."
2430,Pam,"Oh, my God! It's incredible.  Is this the Boggle timer?"
2431,Jim,I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
2432,Dwight,This is so awesome.
2433,Michael,"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to."
2434,Michael,"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!"
2435,Michael,"Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake."
2436,Michael,"Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up."
2437,Michael,Darryl. There you go.  You earned it.
2438,Michael,"No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it."
2439,Darryl,"All right. Thanks, man."
2440,Ryan, Whose butt is that?
2441,Ryan,"Oh, how did I not guess that?"
2442,Michael, Lampshade on head! It's happening!
2443,Dwight,"Oh, hello there.  But what are you doing?"
2444,Dwight,You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
2445,Kevin,"Thanks for the party, Michael."
2446,Michael,"Yeah, that sounds good."
2447,Michael,"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time."
2448,Michael,"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?"
2449,Michael,"Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?"
2450,Dwight,This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
2451,Jim,"Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good."
2452,Dwight,"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy."
2453,Dwight,"Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is."
2454,Pam,"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup."
2455,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup."
2456,Pam,"Um, I don't think so, I just bought it."
2457,Dwight,"Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me."
2458,Dwight,"Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?"
2459,Jim,"Oh, there it is. J1."
2460,Dwight,But I don't have any...
2461,Jim,"Here, you know what? You can have some nickels."
2462,Dwight," Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five..."
2463,Michael,Ah! Ha ha ha!
2464,Pam,"Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo."
2465,Jim,"""It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."""
2466,Pam,A ski mask and a swimsuit.
2467,Jim,"So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers."
2468,Pam,And brush our teeth.
2469,Michael,Banana fana fo fanley.
2470,Michael,Be my mo manley.
2471,Michael,"Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?"
2472,Michael,"Maybe, I don't know."
2473,Michael,"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack."
2474,Michael,This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
2475,Michael,It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
2476,Ryan,I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
2477,Michael,"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan."
2478,Ryan,I'm already in business school.
2479,Michael,To throw you off the scent.
2480,Michael,"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it."
2481,Michael,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Who is this smart little cookie?"" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say."
2482,Michael,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course."
2483,Michael,"Leader... ship. The word ""ship"" is hidden inside the word ""leadership,"" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!"
2484,Oscar,"Last year, Michael's theme was ""Bowl over the Competition!"" So guess where we went."
2485,Michael,"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?"
2486,Darryl,How about the sales department is the sails?
2487,Michael,"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace."
2488,Jim,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?"
2489,Pam,How about the anchor?
2490,Michael,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!"
2491,Jim,I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
2492,Pam,I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
2493,Michael,"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!"
2494,Jim,"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck."
2495,Michael,"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse."
2496,Michael,"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship."
2497,Michael," A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour."
2498,Michael,"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.  Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring...  We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan."
2499,Michael,"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party."
2500,Michael,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose."
2501,Michael,"Hey, look! I'm king of the world!"
2502,Michael,"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!"
2503,Michael,"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight."
2504,Michael,I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
2505,Michael,"If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!"
2506,Michael,We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
2507,Jim,"It's not hilarious, but..."
2508,Michael,"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers."
2509,Michael,"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support."
2510,Dwight,"Me! Me, me, me."
2511,Dwight,"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats."
2512,Michael,"But before that, I have to do my presentation."
2513,Michael,"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!"
2514,Michael,Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
2515,Dwight, What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
2516,Angela,"Hey, come inside and talk to me."
2517,Dwight,"I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!"
2518,Pam,"No, I'm not going to do that."
2519,Darryl,That's what I'm talking about!
2520,Pam,"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?"
2521,Pam,It's getting kind of rowdy down there.
2522,Jim,Yeah.  Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
2523,Pam,Sometimes I just don't get Roy.
2524,Pam,"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?"
2525,Michael,"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?"
2526,Michael,"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers."
2527,Michael,"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership."
2528,Dwight,Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
2529,Dwight,"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour."
2530,Pam,"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice."
2531,Jim,"Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king."
2532,Michael,"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought."
2533,Jim,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
2534,Michael,"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?"
2535,Michael,"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!"
2536,Michael,Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
2537,Pam,"No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there."
2538,Michael,Then I'll give you away!
2539,Jim,I don't know. Let's break up.
2540,Dwight,Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
2541,Michael,Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
2542,Michael,"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a..."
2543,Michael,"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about."
2544,Michael,"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet."
2545,Jim,What happened to you?
2546,Michael,Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
2547,Jim,"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?"
2548,Michael,"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic."
2549,Michael,"Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged."
2550,Jim,She was always engaged.
2551,Michael,Roy said the first one didn't count.
2552,Jim,"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so..."
2553,Michael,"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan..."
2554,Michael,"Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute."
2555,Jim,"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway."
2556,Michael,"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up."
2557,Michael,BFD. Engaged ain't married.
2558,Michael,"Never, ever, ever give up."
2559,Dwight,"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore."
2560,Michael,"It's a fake wheel, dummy."
2561,Oscar,"...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good."
2562,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
2563,Michael,Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
2564,Michael,"I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!"
2565,Pam,"Ok, wait wait wait wait..."
2566,Michael,"Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!"
2567,Pam,"Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!"
2568,Michael,"No, I want you to pick me up."
2569,Pam,"Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt."
2570,Michael,I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
2571,Jim,What is going on?
2572,Michael,I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up. 
2573,Jim,"It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened."
2574,Michael,"OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work."
2575,Michael,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that."
2576,Michael,"Pam, could you come get me?!"
2577,Pam,"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone."
2578,Michael,"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?"
2579,Michael,There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?
2580,Michael,"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
2581,Michael, No one wants to pick me up!?
2582,Dwight, What is going on? What is going on?
2583,Pam,"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him."
2584,Michael,I'm not sick! I'm burned!
2585,Dwight,I'm gonna save you!
2586,Michael,Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.
2587,Dwight,Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
2588,Michael,I don't want Dwight!
2589,Pam,"Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?"
2590,Michael,I don't have a girlfriend.
2591,Jim,But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
2592,Michael,"It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight."
2593,Jim,He hit the pole!
2594,Jim,"It's broken right, he can't..."
2595,Jim,"Oh Dwight, Dwight,  Ohhhhhh!"
2596,Jim,"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!"
2597,Michael,Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
2598,Michael,"Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through."
2599,Pam,"You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate."
2600,Michael,Did you explain why?
2601,Pam,"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot."
2602,Michael,"Burned my foot, Pam."
2603,Michael,Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.
2604,Jim,"So, where are you shipping your foot?"
2605,Michael,Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...
2606,Michael,"Thank you. Pam, messages please?"
2607,Pam,You didn't have any.
2608,Michael,"Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and..."
2609,Pam,And do my job?
2610,Michael,"No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!"
2611,Pam,"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment."
2612,Michael,"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask."
2613,Pam,"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy."
2614,Michael,"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot."
2615,Dwight,"Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to."
2616,Michael,What? Part of your duties are to what?
2617,Michael,"You just said ""part of your duties are to"" something."
2618,Michael,"Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?"
2619,Michael,Where is my cornbread?
2620,Michael,Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?
2621,Ryan,Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
2622,Michael,Where are the yams?
2623,Ryan,They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach.
2624,Michael,Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
2625,Michael,And they had no yams?
2626,Ryan,They had no yams.
2627,Michael,How strange. Because they always have yams.
2628,Dwight,"Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?"
2629,Pam,You've seen one of these?
2630,Dwight,"Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid."
2631,Pam,Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
2632,Dwight,"Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece."
2633,Dwight,"Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!"
2634,Dwight,"Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan."
2635,Pam,Tell me before I come there.
2636,Michael,I want you to rub butter on my foot.
2637,Michael,"Pam, please? I have Country Crock."
2638,Michael,"Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!"
2639,Dwight,These covers are totally indestructible.
2640,Dwight,Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it. 
2641,Dwight,"Oh no, it's broken."
2642,Dwight,"No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long."
2643,Pam,That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!
2644,Jim,"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now."
2645,Pam,"Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend!"
2646,Michael,"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?"
2647,Dwight,Huh. Do you like candy?
2648,Dwight,Cause you're sweeter than candy.
2649,Angela,What is wrong with you? 
2650,Ryan,"You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it."
2651,Michael," No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!"
2652,Michael,I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
2653,Michael,"Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam."
2654,Michael,Get Ryan. He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.
2655,Michael,I just saw him.
2656,Michael,"Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!"
2657,Jim,Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
2658,Pam,"No, he's actually been really nice and helpful."
2659,Jim,And that isn't weird?
2660,Michael,"Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?"
2661,Michael,"Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles."
2662,Michael,"Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!"
2663,Michael,"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me."
2664,Michael," I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!"
2665,Michael,"While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society."
2666,Jim,"Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?"
2667,Michael,"Good question. Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia : AIDS."
2668,Kevin,I think that's from Big.
2669,Michael,"I don't think so, no."
2670,Michael,"He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?"
2671,Michael,What you mean uh hmmm... ?
2672,Michael,"Yes, right in here, come on in."
2673,Michael,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest."
2674,Michael,You are so brave. You are so brave.
2675,Michael,But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
2676,Michael,"Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?"
2677,Michael,"Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me."
2678,Michael,How did you get in your wheelchair?
2679,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny."
2680,Michael,"Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor."
2681,Michael,"Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?"
2682,Jim,I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
2683,Pam,"Dwight, you have your hand up."
2684,Michael,"Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."
2685,Michael,Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
2686,Jim,You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
2687,Ryan,I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
2688,Michael,"You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan."
2689,Ryan,You are very welcome.
2690,Michael,Did you get the yams?
2691,Ryan,"No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!"
2692,Michael," Ok, I'll just have the pudding."
2693,Michael,You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
2694,Michael,"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain."
2695,Ryan,I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
2696,Michael,"Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins."
2697,Jim,"Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion."
2698,Michael,"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him."
2699,Angela,"He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him."
2700,Michael,Why don't you go with him?
2701,Angela,"I, barely know him..."
2702,Dwight,I want Michael to take me...
2703,Michael,"I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity."
2704,Michael,"Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive."
2705,Michael,"We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please."
2706,Jim,"Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator."
2707,Dwight,Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
2708,Jim,"What are you doing? What, stop..."
2709,Jim," Stop, stop, stop, stop."
2710,Jim,You can't lay down.
2711,Dwight,Want to take a rake... .
2712,Pam,"Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight."
2713,Jim,I'm just gonna get...
2714,Pam,"Get up, get up."
2715,Jim,Just keep him awake.
2716,Dwight,It smells like chicken soup.
2717,Dwight,I have to go to the hospital.
2718,Pam,I just want to say goodbye ok?
2719,Dwight,"I'll be back, I mean..."
2720,Pam,"Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different."
2721,Pam,It's just hard to explain.
2722,Dwight,"Aw, Pam, you're adorable "
2723,Jim,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
2724,Michael,"The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout ""shotgun"" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion."
2725,Michael,"Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?"
2726,Jim,"Well, I think she has a kid."
2727,Michael,"Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around."
2728,Dwight,Where are we going?
2729,Jim,"Come on, get inside."
2730,Dwight,Where are we going?
2731,Jim,We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
2732,Michael,"Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
2733,Jim,"We're going to the hospital, Michael."
2734,Michael,"I know, just sayin'."
2735,Michael,"Dwight, what are you drinking?"
2736,Dwight,I found it under the seat.
2737,Jim,"Oh my God, Dwight, put that down."
2738,Jim,Give the bottle to Michael 
2739,Jim,Give the bottle to Michael!
2740,Michael,Give it to me.
2741,Michael,Dwight...  You just keep your eyes on the road.  Give me the bottle or you're fired.
2742,Dwight,"You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!"
2743,Michael,Give it to me Dwight.
2744,Michael,Give me the bottle!!
2745,Michael,"Gimme the bottle, Dwight!"
2746,Michael,"Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!"
2747,Michael,Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!
2748,Michael,"Dwight, what is your middle name."
2749,Michael," Something with a ""K""."
2750,Jim,"It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that."
2751,Michael,"What do I write under ""reason for visit""?"
2752,Jim,Concussion.  What did you write?
2753,Michael,"Nothing. I wrote ""bringing someone to the hospital""."
2754,Jim,So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
2755,Michael,"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. "
2756,Michael,"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
2757,Michael,"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly."
2758,Michael,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?"
2759,Michael,"Ok, what kinda machine is that?"
2760,Dwight,That's what she said.
2761,Michael,"That's my joke, damnit Dwight."
2762,Michael,"It's ok, they're with me."
2763,Michael,"Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off."
2764,Dwight,I don't want to do this.
2765,Michael,"Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out."
2766,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
2767,Jim,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim."
2768,Pam,"Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?"
2769,Jim,"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan."
2770,Pam,I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
2771,Jim,Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.
2772,Pam,Really? Michael went in with him?
2773,Jim,"But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon."
2774,Pam,"Ok, that's uh, good news  Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go."
2775,Pam,"I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow."
2776,Pam,"I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that."
2777,Jim,Not much what's up with you?
2778,Pam,"Oh, I can not believe I fell for that.  Oh, my God."
2779,Michael,"Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me."
2780,Jim,"Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?"
2781,Jim,Nothin' much what's up with you?
2782,Michael,"Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!"
2783,Michael,"Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?"
2784,Michael,"Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog?"
2785,Michael,"I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?"
2786,Kevin,What does that mean?
2787,Michael,What does what mean?
2788,Kevin,The thing you just said?
2789,Michael,Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
2790,Michael,"Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?"
2791,Dwight,Good. How are you doing?
2792,Michael,"Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a..."
2793,Michael,"No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say."
2794,Dwight,"Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?"
2795,Angela,I agree it's unacceptable. 
2796,Kevin,Whhh... What are you guys doing?
2797,Dwight,Oscar is out sick.
2798,Dwight,Can I do some of the talking?
2799,Michael,I will do all the talking.
2800,Dwight,"Ok, let him know that I'm here."
2801,Michael,What difference does it make whether your here?
2802,Michael,"Hi, Oscar its Michael."
2803,Michael,"Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?"
2804,Oscar,Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
2805,Michael,"Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic."
2806,Oscar,"Yeah, I feel terrible about it."
2807,Dwight,Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
2808,Michael,What are your symptoms?
2809,Oscar,I have the chills.
2810,Oscar,I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
2811,Oscar,Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
2812,Michael,I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.
2813,Oscar,I'll just be sleep--- 
2814,Dwight,Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
2815,Michael,That's exactly what I was thinking.
2816,Dwight,Question? May I investigate?
2817,Michael,Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
2818,Pam,I bought my veil.
2819,Pam,"Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and..."
2820,Michael,"Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you."
2821,Jim,Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
2822,Jim,Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
2823,Michael,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can."
2824,Michael,My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles.
2825,Jim,Alright. Great. Thank you.
2826,Michael," Can you hear me, they talk about us..."
2827,Dwight,Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?
2828,Ryan,"Yeah, I think I can handle it."
2829,Jim,I'm going with grape.
2830,Michael,"Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?"
2831,Michael,"Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the ""P"" situation?"
2832,Jim,I don't know what you mean.
2833,Michael,"No it's okay, we're talking code."
2834,Michael,Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
2835,Jim,I'm going to take off actually.
2836,Michael,"Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?"
2837,Michael, Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
2838,Dwight,"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy."
2839,Dwight,"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful."
2840,Jim,Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.
2841,Dwight,"Ok, what is going on here?"
2842,Dwight,"Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim."
2843,Michael,Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
2844,Dwight,Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
2845,Jim,"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material."
2846,Michael,"Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is."
2847,Dwight,Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.
2848,Dwight,I can tell. I won't let you down.
2849,Michael,"Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?"
2850,Jim,I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
2851,Michael,"Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat."
2852,Jim,"No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here."
2853,Michael,Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
2854,Jim,"Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out."
2855,Michael,I know just he place.
2856,Michael," Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?"
2857,Michael,"Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings."
2858,Michael,"Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi."
2859,Michael,"We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers."
2860,Jim,Nope we're not brothers.
2861,Michael,I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
2862,Jim,"Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks."
2863,Michael,"Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?"
2864,Michael,"Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. "
2865,Michael,"No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog."
2866,Dwight,Who took all the black ones?
2867,Pam,That's a communal bowl.
2868,Dwight,"So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?"
2869,Pam,"Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know."
2870,Pam,Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
2871,Pam,"Ok, it was the second one."
2872,Dwight,"Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?"
2873,Michael,What do you like best about Pam?
2874,Jim,"Uh, I really don't want to talk about it."
2875,Michael,"Is it her boobs, or..."
2876,Jim,"Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor."
2877,Michael,Never get's any of my jokes.
2878,Jim,"Wow, that's not what I meant."
2879,Michael,Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
2880,Michael,Thank you very much.
2881,Pam,What did you guys talk about?
2882,Jim," Just you know politics, literature."
2883,Dwight,Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
2884,Michael,Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
2885,Ryan,If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.
2886,Kevin,Michael is that a wig?
2887,Michael,No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
2888,Angela,This is from Hooters.
2889,Michael,"Yeah, it's a business lunch."
2890,Angela,Did Toby approve this?
2891,Michael,No he did not. I don't need his permission.
2892,Michael,"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?"
2893,Michael,I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
2894,Michael,"Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?"
2895,Michael,"You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?"
2896,Angela,"It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy."
2897,Kevin,Jim has got it bad for Pam.
2898,Kevin,Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
2899,Michael,"You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me."
2900,Dwight,"As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved."
2901,Jim,Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I  don't. Riveting.
2902,Pam,Did you find anything good in your desk?
2903,Jim,"Ah, coupon for a free sandwich."
2904,Jim,"It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago."
2905,Jim,"Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here."
2906,Jim,"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael."
2907,Jim,"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean."
2908,Pam,"No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started."
2909,Pam,"No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well."
2910,Jim,"No, no, you saw through me, great."
2911,Pam,So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
2912,Jim,"Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay."
2913,Jim,And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
2914,Dwight,"Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all."
2915,Dwight,This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
2916,Oscar,Are you going to tell Michael?
2917,Dwight,How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
2918,Dwight,"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake."
2919,Michael,"I know, I know, I know."
2920,Michael,"I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid."
2921,Jim,"Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal."
2922,Michael,"Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just."
2923,Jim,"Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?"
2924,Ryan,Creed did you organize the menu book?
2925,Ryan,"No, that was mandatory."
2926,Pam,"Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?"
2927,Michael,"Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim."
2928,Pam,"Oh, no, that's, you don't have to."
2929,Michael,"No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend."
2930,Pam,"No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so."
2931,Michael,It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
2932,Pam,Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
2933,Michael,"Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out."
2934,Michael,"People are always coming to me. ""Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust."" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott."
2935,Jim,"Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that."
2936,Ryan,"Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me."
2937,Pam,"Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?"
2938,Michael,Welcome back! How was your vacation?
2939,Michael,Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!
2940,Pam,"Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January."
2941,Michael,"I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay.  Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck!"
2942,Michael,Wow! What happened in there?
2943,Michael,"There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?"
2944,Pam, Oh... I don't know.
2945,Michael,Is it a bird?
2946,Pam,"No, I don't think it's a bird."
2947,Michael,"Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet."
2948,Michael,"Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office."
2949,Kevin, I don't think that's vomit.
2950,Michael,"Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee."
2951,Michael,"What is it? No, just tell me what it is."
2952,Kevin," Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here. I can't hold my breath that long."
2953,Pam,Open the door up!
2954,Michael,I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
2955,Michael,"How do you know that? What is it, then?"
2956,Michael, Here she comes. All cleaned? Great. 
2957,Michael," I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um...  I can't stand it , I can't stay in here another second. No!"
2958,Jim,"So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot?"
2959,Jim,Good! What's goin' on here?
2960,Jim,What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting.
2961,Ryan, It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me.  It was not me.
2962,Michael, Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
2963,Jim,That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
2964,Jim,But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
2965,Jim,...which I guess I'll be taking.
2966,Michael,"No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing."
2967,Jim,"No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back."
2968,Jim,"Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk."
2969,Jim,Allergy to... the desk?
2970,Michael," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen."
2971,Dwight, Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
2972,Michael,The pressures of my office are insane.
2973,Michael,"I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here."
2974,Dwight,And who had your office?
2975,Michael,"Ed Truck.  Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, ""Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work."" What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away."
2976,Michael,You know who used to sit at that desk?
2977,Dwight,That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
2978,Dwight,I thought he was out on the road.
2979,Michael,"He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes."
2980,Michael,I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
2981,Michael,"Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay."
2982,Michael,"Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired."
2983,Michael,"Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.  It was hysterical."
2984,Ryan,"Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair."
2985,Jim,It's the lever on the side.
2986,Ryan,That's what I told him. Thanks. 
2987,Jim,"No, I don't think I can..."
2988,Michael,Let's send up Accounting.
2989,Michael,Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.
2990,Michael,Yeah! Oh ho ho 
2991,Dwight,Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
2992,Michael,"No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that."
2993,Michael,"Watch out, Pam. You're next!"
2994,Pam,You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
2995,Oscar,"What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it , it makes sense  But it... it was still wrong."
2996,Michael,"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her."
2997,Michael,You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.
2998,Dwight," Hello, am I the 107th caller?  Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller?  Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller?  I'm totally gonna win us that box set."
2999,Michael,Stop it.  Stop. It.  Don't. Don't.
3000,Dwight,I need to make a sales call. Please?
3001,Dwight, Am I the 107th caller?
3002,Pam,"Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend."
3003,Angela,We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
3004,Michael,I'm just walking around.
3005,Oscar,"It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael."
3006,Michael,"Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?"
3007,Michael," Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ...  ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?"
3008,Michael,"Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!"
3009,Dwight,It is so on!
3010,Michael,"God, this is gonna be fun."
3011,Dwight,Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
3012,Michael," So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that!  Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! "
3013,Darryl, What... What's that? Whatcha doing?
3014,Darryl,That was definitely not dancing.
3015,Michael,"You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just..."
3016,Michael,"Yeah, paper business. Is this done?"
3017,Michael,"Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. "
3018,Pam,Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
3019,Oscar,Are you kidding? I thought it was you.
3020,Michael,This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.
3021,Michael,You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
3022,Pam,That doesn't seem fair.
3023,Michael,"You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage."
3024,Dwight,But you're the one who picked today.
3025,Michael,I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
3026,Michael,"Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .  Very well. Then you are all punished."
3027,Michael,You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly.  No. NO! 
3028,Jim,Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward.
3029,Jim,What do you think of Kelly?
3030,Ryan,I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ...  Umm... She's really cool.
3031,Jim,Are you interested in her?
3032,Ryan,Did she say something?
3033,Jim,She said lots of things.
3034,Ryan,Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
3035,Jim,I have no idea.
3036,Ryan,Can you find out?
3037,Michael,Do you remember Ed Truck?
3038,Michael,How would I know?
3039,Michael,My biggest fear is turning into him.
3040,Michael," I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?"
3041,Michael, Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.
3042,Michael,"Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now."
3043,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me."
3044,Michael,"I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible."
3045,Michael,"Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?"
3046,Michael,Well... s-sure I can.
3047,Michael,Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.
3048,Michael,"Well, okay. Different management styles."
3049,Michael,"Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, ""Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney."""
3050,Jim," Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye."
3051,Michael,Who is this? How did you get this number?
3052,Michael,Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?
3053,Michael,Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?
3054,Michael,Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?
3055,Michael,"Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?"
3056,Michael,Are you kidding me? Oh!
3057,Michael,"That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you."
3058,Michael,"Oh.  Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!"
3059,Michael,"It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun.  We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out."
3060,Pam," Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back!"
3061,Pam," Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator."
3062,Pam," Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert."
3063,Pam," I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you."
3064,Pam," Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe."
3065,Pam," Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow."
3066,Pam," Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk."
3067,Pam,Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
3068,Michael," Hey, what's going on?"
3069,Michael,Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
3070,Michael,"Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads..."
3071,Michael,"No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason."
3072,Michael,They did this up in Albany...
3073,Michael,And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
3074,Michael,"Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like..."
3075,Michael, Anybody want any coffee or...
3076,Michael,"Women in the workplace... yeah, translation ""I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls."" Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!"
3077,Pam,Michael's still at the door.
3078,Dwight,It's a terrible idea.
3079,Dwight,Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
3080,Michael,"Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!"
3081,Michael," Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap."
3082,Michael,Let's just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!
3083,Michael,That's what I'm talking about!
3084,Michael,Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
3085,Michael,Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
3086,Michael,We have nowhere else Jan. This...
3087,Dwight,We could do it in the warehouse.
3088,Michael,"OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works."
3089,Michael,"Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months."
3090,Dwight,Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
3091,Michael,"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?"
3092,Darryl,My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
3093,Michael,"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing."
3094,Michael,Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
3095,Michael,Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
3096,Kevin, I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
3097,Jim,"Thanks for the head's up, Kev."
3098,Kevin,I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
3099,Michael," Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little ""Good Will Hunting"" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind."
3100,Angela,I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
3101,Pam,I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
3102,Jim,"Oh, no, no. No."
3103,Jim,Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
3104,Jim,Yeah. I like talking to her too.
3105,Darryl,"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today."
3106,Michael,"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there."
3107,Michael,Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
3108,Dwight,Okay. Let's go. Step up.
3109,Michael,Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are...  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
3110,Dwight,Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
3111,Darryl,"It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this."
3112,Michael,"Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself."
3113,Darryl,Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
3114,Michael,"I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine."
3115,Darryl,"Look, would ya... look."
3116,Michael,"Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up."
3117,Darryl,We're the ones that got to clean that up!
3118,Michael,We ought to have this thing serviced.
3119,Michael,"So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so..."
3120,Michael,"No, why? Why would I... ? You could..."
3121,Pam,"Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way."
3122,Pam,"Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off..."
3123,Pam,"Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um..."
3124,Michael,"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?"
3125,Darryl,My priority is safety.
3126,Darryl,"So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin."
3127,Michael,"OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh..."
3128,Darryl,Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
3129,Michael,I... That was just...
3130,Darryl,That bothers me too.
3131,Michael,"I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men."
3132,Michael,OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
3133,Angela,"I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore."
3134,Darryl,I hate that too.
3135,Kevin,That sucks so much.
3136,Dwight,"Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like ""Gas ain't free!"""
3137,Darryl,"No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?"
3138,Darryl,"You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently."
3139,Darryl,We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
3140,Michael,"Ah, you do. So..."
3141,Darryl,But we get paid a lot less.
3142,Michael,I know. God! What is that?
3143,Michael,"It blows. It blows, man. Gah..."
3144,Darryl,You know this would not happen if we had a union.
3145,Michael,"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah."
3146,Darryl,That's what we need.
3147,Darryl,"Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally."
3148,Michael,You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
3149,Darryl,"It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?"
3150,Darryl,"Man, hook you up."
3151,Michael,Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
3152,Michael,The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
3153,Darryl,Are you with us Mike?
3154,Darryl,Welcome to the warehouse.
3155,Michael," This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points..."
3156,Michael,Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
3157,Michael,Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
3158,Michael,Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
3159,Michael,But we're bonding down there!
3160,Michael,I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
3161,Michael,Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
3162,Michael,We have a history...
3163,Michael,I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
3164,Ryan,You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
3165,Pam,How's it going down there?
3166,Jim,"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?"
3167,Pam,Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
3168,Pam,"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great."
3169,Jim,"Nice. Well, what's it all about?"
3170,Jim,I think you should do it. That's great!
3171,Michael,"Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?"
3172,Angela,"At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God."
3173,Michael,"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially..."
3174,Michael,I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
3175,Pam,Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
3176,Jim,So you're not doing it.
3177,Pam,How did you know?
3178,Pam,Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
3179,Pam,Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
3180,Pam,What? You have something you want to say?
3181,Jim,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?"
3182,Pam,"Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!"
3183,Pam,"It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... ."
3184,Michael,I'm just going to put this over there.
3185,Darryl,This is not a good idea right here.
3186,Michael,You did uh... okay.
3187,Michael,Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?
3188,Michael,"Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch."
3189,Michael,"Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship."
3190,Michael,Thank you to our hosts.
3191,Darryl,Hey Michael. This ain't over.
3192,Michael,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
3193,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please."
3194,Pam,"I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and..."
3195,Pam,"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big."
3196,Michael,"Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO."
3197,Dwight,And you want me to come with you.
3198,Michael,Nope. The opposite of that.
3199,Dwight,I will stay here and run things on this end.
3200,Dwight,Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
3201,Michael,"I probably will, why do you ask?"
3202,Dwight,"Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know..."
3203,Michael,"This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love."
3204,Michael,"Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?"
3205,Oscar,"The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO."
3206,Michael,"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!"
3207,Michael,"Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name."
3208,Jim,"So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great."
3209,Dwight,What's this? What is this?
3210,Dwight,"Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?"
3211,Jim,It was there when I sat down.
3212,Dwight, Happy Valentine's Day.  It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes!  Ahh!
3213,Michael,"The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. "
3214,Jim,Hey Kelly. What's up?
3215,Jim,"OH, that's great. I'm really happy for "
3216,Ryan, I hooked up with her on February 13th.
3217,Michael,"Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here."
3218,Michael,"Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to  Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there."
3219,Michael,"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh."
3220,Dwight,"Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten."
3221,Angela,"Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it."
3222,Dwight,Oh I did. I did.
3223,Angela,I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
3224,Dwight,"Oh, I bet you will before the day is over."
3225,Angela,"Really? Well, I hope I do."
3226,Michael,"I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it."
3227,Jim," Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye."
3228,Kevin,"Man, that thing's bigger than I am."
3229,Michael,There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
3230,Michael,"Josh Porter, high five.  Bam."
3231,Michael,"Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. "
3232,Michael,"You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?"
3233,Michael,So what's going on? What I miss?
3234,Michael,"Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... "
3235,Dwight,"Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?"
3236,Pam,"You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here."
3237,Dwight,"No, Pam, Just. Just, "
3238,Pam,You need to get something for your girlfriend.
3239,Dwight," Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of..."
3240,Pam,"Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is."
3241,Dwight,"You mean, like a ham?"
3242,Pam,"No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her."
3243,Dwight,"Ok, I get it."
3244,Pam,That you remember her.
3245,Dwight,"Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. "
3246,Michael,"Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it."
3247,Michael,"Maybe because she's my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and..."
3248,Michael,"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,"
3249,Jim,Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... 
3250,Jim," Oh, no, not while I'm here."
3251,Ryan,I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
3252,Michael,Ditto.  How are you Jan?
3253,Michael,"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. "
3254,Michael," Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on."
3255,Michael,"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about."
3256,Michael," And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. "
3257,Michael,"Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... "
3258,Jim,"You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't."
3259,Jim,"Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight."
3260,Michael,"Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So..."
3261,Michael,Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
3262,Michael,I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
3263,Dwight,"Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving."
3264,Pam,"Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her."
3265,Michael,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. "
3266,Michael,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. "
3267,Michael,"I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again."
3268,Jim,"Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day."
3269,Michael,"Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again."
3270,Michael,"Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. "
3271,Michael,Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
3272,Dwight,They are either going to say yes... or no.
3273,Michael,Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
3274,Michael,Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
3275,Michael,"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted."
3276,Michael,"Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me."
3277,Dwight,Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
3278,Michael,You all right Ryan?
3279,Dwight,"Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?"
3280,Dwight,"Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?"
3281,Jim,"Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so..."
3282,Jim,What did I do to deserve this?
3283,Pam,Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
3284,Pam,"Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?"
3285,Pam,Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
3286,Jim,"Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later."
3287,Pam,I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
3288,Michael,That's what she said!
3289,Dwight,Ha! I don't get it.
3290,Michael,Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
3291,Dwight,"Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?"
3292,Michael,"Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life."
3293,Michael,"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year."
3294,Dwight,"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, ""Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..."""
3295,Michael,That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
3296,Dwight,"When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'."
3297,Dwight,I can't do this.
3298,Michael,"That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time."
3299,Michael,But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
3300,Dwight,"Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked."
3301,Michael,"Well, if you have a question, you should ask me."
3302,Dwight,I'll try and think of one. When...
3303,Michael,Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
3304,Dwight,Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
3305,Pam,"Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my..."
3306,Jim,"Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?"
3307,Jim,I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
3308,Jim,Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
3309,Oscar,"I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care."
3310,Michael," But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?"
3311,Dwight,Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.
3312,Michael,"It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class."
3313,Michael,"Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!"
3314,Dwight,Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
3315,Michael,I do. Both of them.
3316,Dwight,Could I have a copy of one of them?
3317,Michael,"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this."
3318,Michael,Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
3319,Michael,"You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them."
3320,Dwight,That is so great about the bonus!
3321,Michael,"No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience."
3322,Dwight,Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
3323,Pam,Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
3324,Dwight,Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
3325,Dwight,"He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing."
3326,Oscar,What the hell is going on here?
3327,Angela,Are we out of jobs?
3328,Michael,He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
3329,Michael,All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
3330,Michael,"As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking."
3331,Michael,"Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast."
3332,Pam,"Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?"
3333,Michael,Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
3334,Jim,So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
3335,Kevin,You should go to Hedonism.
3336,Kevin,"It's like Club Med, but everything is naked."
3337,Jim,"I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice."
3338,Michael,Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
3339,Jim,When did you go there?
3340,Jim,Really for like how long?
3341,Jim,Where do I want to go?
3342,Michael,"Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today."
3343,Dwight,"Good morning, Vietnam!  Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates."
3344,Dwight,"Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager."
3345,Jim,Which means absolutely nothing.
3346,Dwight,"Michael, can you explain?"
3347,Michael,"Well, it's mostly made up. So..."
3348,Michael,Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
3349,Jim,Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
3350,Dwight,I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
3351,Jim,Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
3352,Dwight,Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
3353,Jim,You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
3354,Jim,Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
3355,Jim,"The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did."
3356,Jim,You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
3357,Jim,"Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini."
3358,Dwight,I'll glance at it.
3359,Michael,"It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here."
3360,Angela,"The very best of luck to you, Dwight."
3361,Pam,Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
3362,Pam,Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
3363,Michael,All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
3364,Angela,  I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
3365,Kevin,"I've never, ever seen you take a sick day."
3366,Angela,"Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us."
3367,Michael,"Dwight, they called your name."
3368,Dwight,"No, I can't... I ca..."
3369,Michael,All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you.  All right!
3370,Michael,"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?"
3371,Kevin,I always set it at 69. 
3372,Pam,Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
3373,Ryan,"Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married."
3374,Pam,"Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just..."
3375,Ryan,I know what I said.
3376,Michael,"I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?"
3377,Michael,"Car starting.  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone."
3378,Michael,Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
3379,Dwight," Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.  how long we have been striving for greatness?  Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you  and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!"
3380,Dwight,"Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!"
3381,Oscar,I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
3382,Ryan,You really think you're going to go?
3383,Jim,Yeah. I'm definitely going.
3384,Ryan,Nice. Send me a postcard.
3385,Ryan,"Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia."
3386,Dwight,No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. 
3387,Dwight,"Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is..."
3388,Pam,Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
3389,Jim,"I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable."
3390,Pam,That's awesome. Where are you staying?
3391,Jim,I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
3392,Pam,When are you leaving?
3393,Jim,I'm... leaving on June 8th.
3394,Jim,"Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just..."
3395,Pam,Oh yeah. That's too bad.
3396,Jim,Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
3397,Pam,It's ok. I got it.
3398,Dwight,"Ok, thanks.  There you are. What happened?"
3399,Michael,I got thirsty. How'd it go?
3400,Dwight,It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
3401,Michael,You would not believe what happened here.
3402,Michael,"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35."
3403,Michael,"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'"
3404,Michael,She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
3405,Michael,"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?"
3406,Pam,"I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel."
3407,Pam,"Oh, I have more. "
3408,Michael,Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
3409,Pam,"Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today.  'Cause of the... "
3410,Michael,"... Oh, God is that today?"
3411,Pam,I reminded you last night.
3412,Michael,"Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in ""Raw,"" and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in ""Daddy Daycare."" both great movies, but, still."
3413,Michael,"Well, I'll be in my office."
3414,Pam,Don't you think you should say something?
3415,Pam,"Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---"
3416,Michael,"Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City."
3417,Michael,"Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?"
3418,Michael, I work with a bunch of nerds.
3419,Dwight, Mmm... hello tiny one.
3420,Dwight,You are the future!
3421,Kevin,This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
3422,Kevin,"Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check."
3423,Michael,"Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her."
3424,Michael,"Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time."
3425,Michael,"It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle."
3426,Michael, They want how many spiral pads?
3427,Angela,Can you put that down there?
3428,Angela,"No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves."
3429,Angela,"I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys."
3430,Ryan,"Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me."
3431,Michael," Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.  ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different.  Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow."
3432,Pam,"Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool."
3433,Pam,I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
3434,Jim,What are you reading?
3435,Jim,"Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?"
3436,Jim,"Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped."
3437,Jim,"Yesss. And you're Abby, right?"
3438,Jim,I'm Jim.  Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
3439,Jim,Let's start with... your mom.
3440,Michael," Yes. Well... we can...  uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright.  Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?"
3441,Michael,Nice to meet you.
3442,Michael,"Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor.  But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try?"
3443,Michael,"All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! "
3444,Jim," Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand."
3445,Dwight,There is no way that hurt.
3446,Jim,"Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight."
3447,Dwight,"Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day.  I don't feel anything. Nothing.  You're so weak.  Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?"
3448,Dwight,"No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate."
3449,Dwight,You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
3450,Dwight,You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
3451,Ryan,Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
3452,Dwight," That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864.  The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!"
3453,Michael,What the hell are you reading to them?
3454,Dwight,"These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---"
3455,Michael,"Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you."
3456,Dwight, Nazi was a fascist movement...
3457,Michael,"Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?"
3458,Dwight,I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
3459,Michael, Why don't you just leave? Okay?
3460,Michael,"Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?"
3461,Michael,"Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. "
3462,Angela,"You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities ."
3463,Michael,"This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?"
3464,Michael,"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it."
3465,Michael,"Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate..."
3466,Michael,I'm not just a middle... man...
3467,Michael,"You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business."
3468,Dwight,We have better service than they do!
3469,Michael,"...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?"
3470,Michael,Say hi to the kids.
3471,Michael,"What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?"
3472,Michael,"No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?"
3473,Michael,"You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show."
3474,Michael,It's true. I did.
3475,Michael,I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
3476,Michael,"It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar."
3477,Michael,I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
3478,Ryan,"Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so..."
3479,Ryan,No! I will... go.
3480,Michael,"Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office."
3481,Michael," Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?"
3482,Michael,"I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake."
3483,Michael,"I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?"
3484,Michael,"That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to..."
3485,Dwight,Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
3486,Michael,"Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow."
3487,Oscar,Is that Chet Montgomery?
3488,Michael,"Uhh, I don't know."
3489,Darryl,Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
3490,Michael,"Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it."
3491,Michael,Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
3492,Michael,Coulda sworn there was...
3493,Michael,"Uh, just never happened."
3494,Michael,"...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye."
3495,Pam,He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
3496,Jim,"Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy."
3497,Dwight,"Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name."
3498,Dwight,Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
3499,Michael,"Oh, that's okay, she can keep those."
3500,Michael,You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
3501,Michael,"Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost."
3502,Michael,"Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?"
3503,Michael,"Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I..."
3504,Pam,"It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?"
3505,Pam,Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there.  Cool huh?
3506,Pam,"Yeah, I get to do this like, every week."
3507,Michael,"Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at."
3508,Jim,"Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? "
3509,Kevin,What're you doing? You never have plans.
3510,Jim,"Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date."
3511,Michael,"Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do."
3512,Michael, You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
3513,Jim,Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
3514,Pam,I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. 
3515,Pam,My theory is that... 
3516,Dwight,"And they do, your parents, love you very much."
3517,Michael,One more time.  You...
3518,Dwight,"The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood.  They didn't eat the children."
3519,Michael,"So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you."
3520,Oscar,Who is this guy again?
3521,Michael,Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
3522,Ryan,Who uses calling cards anymore?
3523,Michael,"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend."
3524,Oscar,This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
3525,Michael,Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
3526,Michael,"You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright."
3527,Jim,"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?"
3528,Michael,"Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's...  ... I have to go make a call."
3529,Michael,Oh ho ho! What?
3530,Pam,I said happy birthday.
3531,Michael,Thank you! That's really nice.
3532,Jim,"Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday."
3533,Michael,"Ah, thank you sir."
3534,Kevin,No. I'm still waiting.
3535,Dwight,"Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!"
3536,Michael,"No no no, no, new suit, please."
3537,Dwight,That suit is amazing.
3538,Michael,"Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria."
3539,Dwight,Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
3540,Michael,Good luck. One of a kind.
3541,Dwight,Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
3542,Michael,"Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday."
3543,Dwight,"Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the..."
3544,Michael,"Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise."
3545,Dwight,Let's get the party started. 
3546,Michael,Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you! 
3547,Angela,"One thirty.  I'm sorry, are we boring you?"
3548,Dwight,"Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority."
3549,Dwight,Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. 
3550,Pam,Michael wants a strippergram?
3551,Dwight,"Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom."
3552,Angela,No. This is a closed door meeting.
3553,Pam,"Michael, I have Jan on the line."
3554,Michael,"Oh, great, put her through."
3555,Michael,"It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday."
3556,Michael,"Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday."
3557,Michael,Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. 
3558,Michael," ...You can take a five, if you want."
3559,Michael,Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
3560,Jim,"Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?"
3561,Kevin,They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
3562,Kevin,"Um, I might have skin cancer."
3563,Jim,"Kelly, you know what..."
3564,Michael,Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
3565,Michael,You didn't know it was my birthday.
3566,Michael,"Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut ."
3567,Oscar,Skin cancer is treatable.
3568,Oscar,It's going to be okay.
3569,Angela,"You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though."
3570,Michael,"Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?"
3571,Michael, Okay. I'm so nervous.
3572,Pam,I can sign for it.
3573,Michael,"When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday."
3574,Michael, Stop it. Stop! What is that?
3575,Dwight,"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song."
3576,Michael,"Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything."
3577,Dwight,I probably care more than she does.
3578,Michael,You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .
3579,Pam,When does he hear?
3580,Pam,"If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week."
3581,Dwight,"Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!"
3582,Dwight,"Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please."
3583,Dwight,There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
3584,Dwight,So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
3585,Michael,"Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this."
3586,Dwight,Creed! Come on. Stanley!
3587,Pam,...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
3588,Jim,"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and..."
3589,Dwight,"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?"
3590,Dwight,"Happy birth moment, Michael."
3591,Michael,Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
3592,Dwight,"F. Alright, what's the damage?"
3593,Dwight,"Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones."
3594,Michael,Get in here... everybody.
3595,Dwight,Come and get it!
3596,Michael,Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
3597,Dwight,"Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup."
3598,Angela,Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
3599,Michael,"Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good."
3600,Michael,"Just the bread, it's fresh baked."
3601,Michael,Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.
3602,Jim,"So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back."
3603,Pam,Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
3604,Jim,"Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number."
3605,Pam,And his favorite lunch.
3606,Dwight,"Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left ."
3607,Ryan, Someone ate three feet of that thing?
3608,Dwight,"Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake."
3609,Dwight,Oh. I got it.
3610,Angela,What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
3611,Dwight, This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
3612,Dwight,What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
3613,Angela,Yes...  but don't expect any cookie.
3614,Dwight, But what if i'm hungry?
3615,Pam,You use fabric softener?
3616,Michael,Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
3617,Kevin,"No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye.  It was just Stacy."
3618,Michael,Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
3619,Dwight,Here we go. Make a wish.
3620,Michael,Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... 
3621,Michael,... I asked for trick candles.
3622,Dwight,Pam was supposed to get 'em.
3623,Michael,"Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day."
3624,Angela,No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
3625,Michael,"... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us ."
3626,Pam, We should probably head back.
3627,Jim,Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
3628,Pam,You dare me? How old are you?
3629,Pam," Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner."
3630,Pam," Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you..."
3631,Pam,Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3632,Jim,How old are you?
3633,Michael,There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
3634,Michael,"Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is."
3635,Kevin,Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
3636,Michael,Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
3637,Michael," Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day."
3638,Kevin,"If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy."
3639,Michael,"Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry."
3640,Dwight,"Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls."
3641,Jim,"Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael."
3642,Michael,"Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun."
3643,Michael,How dare you sir. You are gross.
3644,Michael, That should not be there.
3645,Dwight,I'll get someone to take it down.
3646,Michael,"No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!"
3647,Ryan,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
3648,Jim,Think you can let go?
3649,Jim,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. 
3650,Michael,"Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids."
3651,Michael,"Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it."
3652,Jim,...It's something to think about.
3653,Kevin,"I can't relax about it, you know?"
3654,Michael,Kevin. You heard anything yet?
3655,Michael,Okay. Well. Live strong.
3656,Michael,"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or..."
3657,Michael,"Oh, these... all your kids?"
3658,Michael,"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?"
3659,Michael,Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
3660,Michael,Push. Good! That's great. You got it.  Excuse me.
3661,Kevin,"Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks.  It was negative."
3662,Michael,"Oh... God...  God!  We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here ."
3663,Michael,"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos."
3664,Kevin,"This is awesome. Thanks, you guys."
3665,Michael,"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!"
3666,Dwight,Turn it around. Turn it around.
3667,Michael,Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
3668,Michael,Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
3669,Pam,This is from all of us.
3670,Michael,Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
3671,Pam,Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
3672,Dwight,"Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out.  Spit... Okay, come on, let's go."
3673,Jim,"You look cute today, Dwight."
3674,Dwight,"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation."
3675,Dwight,"I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't."
3676,Jim, I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
3677,Pam," Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um,  that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can."
3678,Dwight,"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?"
3679,Dwight,I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
3680,Ryan,I go to a lot of parties.
3681,Dwight,"Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys."
3682,Ryan,I am not giving you my keys.
3683,Dwight,Don't make me do this the hard way.
3684,Ryan,What's the hard way?
3685,Dwight,"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him."
3686,Ryan,"Yeah, let's do it that way."
3687,Michael,"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow."
3688,Dwight,I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
3689,Jim,Whoa. You are a volunteer.
3690,Dwight,I volunteered for this job.
3691,Jim,And that's not the same.
3692,Dwight,It is my duty...
3693,Dwight,...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
3694,Dwight,If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
3695,Michael,I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
3696,Dwight,...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
3697,Dwight,...and I am very proud of being a narc.
3698,Michael,"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, where's my office?  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!"
3699,Jim,"Well, your office is behind you."
3700,Michael,Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
3701,Ryan,I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
3702,Dwight,Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
3703,Dwight,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
3704,Oscar,"No, I have not."
3705,Dwight,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
3706,Oscar,What are you implying?
3707,Dwight,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
3708,Oscar,Okay. I'm done with this.
3709,Dwight,He sure left in a hurry.
3710,Dwight,I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
3711,Dwight,Do you know what this is? 
3712,Dwight,How do you know that?
3713,Jim,I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
3714,Dwight,"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me."
3715,Jim,"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember."
3716,Jim,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?"
3717,Dwight,That's not how it works.
3718,Jim,Now how do you know how it works?
3719,Dwight,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you."
3720,Jim,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
3721,Oscar,"So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it."
3722,Jim,"Oh, um... Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me? "
3723,Jim,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression."
3724,Pam,He does everyone in the office.
3725,Pam,Jinx! Buy me a coke.
3726,Pam,"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid. "
3727,Pam,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
3728,Pam,"Sorry, that's not my problem."
3729,Dwight,"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently."
3730,Dwight,Where were you yesterday after work?
3731,Michael,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?
3732,Kevin,"That is so good, Michael"
3733,Michael,"Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, who's in trouble?"
3734,Dwight,Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
3735,Michael,Waa... what? What are you talking about?
3736,Dwight,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
3737,Oscar,"Is that true, Toby?"
3738,Michael,"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it."
3739,Michael,"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection."
3740,Dwight,No you can't do that.
3741,Michael,"I can do that, it is my office."
3742,Michael,Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great.
3743,Dwight,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?"
3744,Kevin,I'm not taking Rogaine.
3745,Dwight,"Angela, what about you?"
3746,Angela,I don't take any prescription drugs.
3747,Pam,"Hey guys, what's going on?"
3748,Pam,"Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. "
3749,Michael,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
3750,Angela,"No, not at all."
3751,Oscar,You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
3752,Michael,"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, ""Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."""
3753,Michael,"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind."
3754,Michael,"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children."
3755,Michael,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?"
3756,Michael,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
3757,Michael,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?"
3758,Michael,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair."
3759,Michael,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly."
3760,Michael,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam."
3761,Pam,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
3762,Michael,"Jim it's okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he's doing it, okay.  It's okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well."
3763,Pam,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
3764,Michael,"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not."
3765,Dwight,"No, you will be tested."
3766,Michael,"Yes, I will not be."
3767,Dwight,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
3768,Michael,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you."
3769,Dwight,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy."
3770,Michael,So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
3771,Dwight,What kind of filing?
3772,Michael,Just forget it. Just the urine.
3773,Dwight,That goes directly to the tester.
3774,Michael,Just. I need your urine.
3775,Dwight,Like in a cup?
3776,Michael,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight."
3777,Michael,It's none of your business.
3778,Michael,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring."
3779,Michael,I need clean urine for the lady.
3780,Michael,"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes"
3781,Michael,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
3782,Dwight,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
3783,Michael,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup."
3784,Angela,Do you want to give Michael your urine?
3785,Dwight,I want him to have all the urine he needs.
3786,Angela,You're not going to get my permission on this.
3787,Dwight,I know that. Don't you think I know that?
3788,Ryan,"Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?"
3789,Dwight,"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out."
3790,Pam,"What?  Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.  You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason.  Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. "
3791,Kevin,I'd like a magazine.
3792,Kevin,I'd still like one.
3793,Michael,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much."
3794,Michael,What's wrong? Where's your costume?
3795,Dwight,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
3796,Dwight,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
3797,Pam, Here.  Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. 
3798,Jim,How much time do you have left on your break?
3799,Michael,"Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch."
3800,Dwight,That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
3801,Michael,So you wanna? Thanks.
3802,Dwight,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great.  Can I have a gun?"
3803,Dwight,"Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff."
3804,Dwight,I need to go over some details with you.
3805,Michael,"Alright.  Well, Thank you."
3806,Dwight,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?"
3807,Jim,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
3808,Kevin,"So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?"
3809,Kevin,'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
3810,Jim,"Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out."
3811,Angela,I didn't get mine yet.
3812,Pam,"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy."
3813,Michael,"Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent."
3814,Dwight,Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
3815,Dwight,"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?"
3816,Michael,That's a nice tie.
3817,Michael,That is... who makes that?
3818,Michael,Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
3819,Ryan,"Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes."
3820,Oscar,"It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed..."
3821,Michael,"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?"
3822,Michael,What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
3823,Michael,"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?"
3824,Michael," A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style."
3825,Angela,Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
3826,Michael,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose."
3827,Oscar,What's the next one?
3828,Michael,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?"
3829,Angela,Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
3830,Michael,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work."
3831,Michael," Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using ""I"" emotion language and no judging or ""you"" statements."
3832,Angela,"I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor."
3833,Michael,"Come on, seriously, that?"
3834,Oscar,"I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the..."
3835,Michael,"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win."
3836,Michael,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win."
3837,Michael,"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution."
3838,Angela,"How about, I leave it up?"
3839,Oscar,"How 'bout, she takes it down?"
3840,Pam,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
3841,Michael,"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win."
3842,Pam,"Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code."
3843,Angela,"It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste."
3844,Michael,Are those all the other complains?
3845,Michael,I would like to see those please.
3846,Michael,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file."
3847,Michael,Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?
3848,Michael,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
3849,Dwight,"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot."
3850,Michael," This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist."
3851,Michael,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
3852,Michael,"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?"
3853,Angela,You already did me.
3854,Michael,"That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does ""redacted"" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked ""redacted""... ?"
3855,Michael,"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago."
3856,Dwight,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?"
3857,Pam, Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
3858,Michael,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next."
3859,Pam,"Wait, what did it say?"
3860,Michael,"Uh... ""Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?""  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?"
3861,Pam,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
3862,Michael,"Here is a Kelly complaint: ""Ryan never returns my calls."" Ugh, join the club."
3863,Ryan,My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
3864,Jim,Dwight tried to kiss me.
3865,Jim,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
3866,Dwight,That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
3867,Jim,"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it."
3868,Dwight,"Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?"
3869,Pam, Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
3870,Michael, You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
3871,Pam,I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
3872,Michael,"Someone complained that the men's room is ""whites only"". Stanley, you know that's not true."
3873,Michael,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee."
3874,Michael,"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him."
3875,Pam,"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby."
3876,Jim,"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends."
3877,Pam,Don't take her side.
3878,Jim," Well, what does Roy think about everything?"
3879,Pam,I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
3880,Jim,You mean your thoughts and feelings?
3881,Angela,"Yes, that's the problem."
3882,Michael,"Okay, well... all settled, then."
3883,Michael,"OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?"
3884,Michael,"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable."
3885,Kevin,I accept your decision!
3886,Jim,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together."
3887,Dwight,That doesn't make any sense.
3888,Jim,"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect."
3889,Dwight,"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life."
3890,Jim,This came out really well.  There you go.
3891,Dwight,This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
3892,Dwight,"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'."
3893,Jim,What did I write?
3894,Dwight,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
3895,Dwight,"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand."
3896,Dwight,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
3897,Dwight,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
3898,Dwight,"Either he goes, or I go."
3899,Dwight,One of us is out of here by the end of today! 
3900,Dwight,I am not bluffing!
3901,Dwight,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years."
3902,Dwight,I deserve this. You know I do!
3903,Michael, You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
3904,Dwight,You have till five.
3905,Dwight,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!"
3906,Michael,"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!"
3907,Michael,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage."
3908,Michael,"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  ""Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.""  ""Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."""
3909,Jim, Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
3910,Michael," ""This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.""  ""Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."" Gah. ""This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."""
3911,Jim,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out."
3912,Michael," ""Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'."""
3913,Jim,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though."
3914,Michael,"""By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."""
3915,Jim,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day."
3916,Michael,"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful."
3917,Jim,Maybe Stanford would be cool.
3918,Dwight,It's a good market. Higher volume.
3919,Jim,Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
3920,Dwight,I have a girlfriend...
3921,Jim,"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure."
3922,Michael,"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later."
3923,Dwight,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?"
3924,Michael,"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work."
3925,Dwight,I want an answer by tomorrow.
3926,Michael,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?"
3927,Michael,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
3928,Michael,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?"
3929,Michael,It'll take like two seconds.
3930,Michael,"Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter."
3931,Dwight,"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go."
3932,Michael,"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts."
3933,Michael,"Good, let's check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more."
3934,Pam,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something."
3935,Michael, You just press the button.
3936,Pam, I am.  It's about the Save The Date.
3937,Jim,"Pam, it wasn't her."
3938,Jim,I'm the one who complained about you.
3939,Jim,I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.
3940,Michael," Okay, good. Check that out."
3941,Jim,"You know, it was one day."
3942,Jim,And I took it right back. It was like...
3943,Michael," Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. "
3944,Michael,It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
3945,Michael," One, two.. Didn't say three, did I?"
3946,Michael,"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems."
3947,Jim," Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. "
3948,Michael,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
3949,Michael,"Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, ""Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening."" Makes you feel good."
3950,Jim,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
3951,Dwight,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years."
3952,Pam,It's a nice tux.
3953,Dwight,"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom."
3954,Pam,"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert."
3955,Dwight,"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance."
3956,Jim,I can always kind of win at roulette.
3957,Dwight,How would you do that?
3958,Dwight, You can't be serious. Are you serious?
3959,Jim,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind."
3960,Dwight,I don't believe you. Continue.
3961,Jim,"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things."
3962,Dwight," That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead."
3963,Michael,I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
3964,Michael,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!"
3965,Michael,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here."
3966,Michael,"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez."
3967,Michael,"Oh, come on. Come on."
3968,Michael,"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break."
3969,Michael,"Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day."
3970,Michael,"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America."
3971,Oscar,Again? We do that every year.
3972,Michael,"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts."
3973,Oscar,It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
3974,Michael,"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration."
3975,Michael,"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief."
3976,Jim,That doesn't exist anymore.
3977,Michael,"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people."
3978,Pam,"No, they stopped making that show."
3979,Michael,"Well, then, they need our money more than ever."
3980,Angela,"You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization."
3981,Kevin,Something with animals. Or people.
3982,Angela,"We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?"
3983,Michael,"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna..."
3984,Michael,"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS."
3985,Jim,I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
3986,Michael,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS."
3987,Michael,No. Humans with AIDS.
3988,Michael,"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried."
3989,Michael,"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. ""I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.""  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams."
3990,Jim,What are you doing?
3991,Jim,"""Till Death Do Us Rock."""
3992,Pam,"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now."
3993,Jim,"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams."
3994,Pam,There's a KISS cover band in here.
3995,Pam,I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
3996,Jim,"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here."
3997,Michael,I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
3998,Darryl,"Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse."
3999,Michael,It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
4000,Michael,"Well, actually, it's my warehouse."
4001,Dwight,"Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease."
4002,Michael,Why are you here?
4003,Dwight,"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection."
4004,Michael,"Not. I said, not that."
4005,Darryl,We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
4006,Michael,That you are afraid.
4007,Darryl,Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
4008,Darryl,"I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, ""Fleece it out."" ""Going mach five."" ""Dinkin' flicka."" You know, things us Negroes say."
4009,Darryl,"Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too."
4010,Jim, Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
4011,Pam,I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
4012,Pam,"Have three stages, yeah."
4013,Jim,"Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity."
4014,Jim,Let's take a look. Nice.
4015,Pam,"Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums."
4016,Pam,On the drums! On the drums!
4017,Jim,"Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer."
4018,Kevin,We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
4019,Jim,"Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna..."
4020,Jim,"No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding."
4021,Pam,"No, come back! No, no, no!"
4022,Pam,Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
4023,Pam," Michael, Carol Stills for you."
4024,Michael,Do I know a Carol Stills?
4025,Pam,Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
4026,Pam,"Carol, you're on with Michael."
4027,Michael,"Hi, Carol. How you doing?"
4028,Michael,"Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place."
4029,Michael,"Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped."
4030,Michael,"Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night."
4031,Michael,"Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink."
4032,Michael,Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
4033,Michael,"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?"
4034,Pam,"Michael, Jan's on line two."
4035,Michael,"Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?"
4036,Pam,"It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael."
4037,Michael,"Hey, Jan. How you doing?"
4038,Michael,"Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just..."
4039,Michael,"Good, All right. Sounds great."
4040,Michael,Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
4041,Michael,"Oh, well... Kiss.  That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight "
4042,Dwight,Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
4043,Dwight,"I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, ""We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."""
4044,Michael,Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
4045,Michael,"Billy, your nurse is hot."
4046,Michael,Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
4047,Michael,"Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss."
4048,Michael,"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows."
4049,Michael,"Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?"
4050,Michael,What are... That's insane.
4051,Michael,"Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back."
4052,Michael,"Okay, all right, whatever."
4053,Michael,You really screwed that up. 
4054,Dwight,"I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs."
4055,Jim, I will raise.  Thanks.
4056,Jim,"It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds."
4057,Michael,"Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
4058,Michael,"Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship."
4059,Michael,"After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong."
4060,Dwight,Give me the dice.
4061,Angela,"Good evening, Dwight. What is this?"
4062,Dwight,"Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins."
4063,Angela,Then roll an eight.
4064,Kevin,"Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go."
4065,Oscar,Let it ride. Let it all ride.
4066,Dwight,Give me the dice!
4067,Pam, I have good cards.
4068,Pam,"Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in."
4069,Jim,Wow. I think you're bluffing.
4070,Kevin,"Yeah, I think she's full of it."
4071,Kevin,"Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen."
4072,Jim,Thank you very much. It was fun.
4073,Ryan,"One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can."
4074,Jim,"So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?"
4075,Michael,"Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!"
4076,Michael,So close. So close.
4077,Dwight,Come on.  So where you staying? Radisson?
4078,Dwight,Motel 6? Best Western?
4079,Dwight,Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
4080,Kevin,"I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker."
4081,Oscar,"No, that's a flush."
4082,Kevin,I do not want to talk about it.
4083,Kevin,Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
4084,Kevin,"Dude, you will not be sorry."
4085,Jim,"No, thanks. You having fun?"
4086,Jim,"Yeah, we all really..."
4087,Jim,"Well, I think you look great."
4088,Jim,"Yeah, why did you?"
4089,Pam,It's okay. I'll see you at home.
4090,Jim,"Hey, how's it going?"
4091,Pam,"Good, especially after I took all your money in poker."
4092,Jim,"Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?"
4093,Pam,About when you want to give me more of your money?
4094,Pam,Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
4095,Jim,I was just... I'm in love with you.
4096,Jim,"I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just..."
4097,Pam,What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
4098,Jim,I just needed you to know. Once.
4099,Pam,"Well, I um... I... I can't."
4100,Pam,You have no idea...
4101,Pam,...what your friendship means to me.
4102,Pam,I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
4103,Jim,Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
4104,Michael,Okay. Thanks for coming.
4105,Michael,Okay. Talk to you Monday.
4106,Michael,Good night. She's a good boss.
4107,Michael,"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good."
4108,Pam," About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am.  I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... "
4109,Jim, You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
4110,Pam,Me too. ...I think we're just drunk.
4111,Jim,No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk?
4112,Jim,Are you really gonna marry him?  ...Ok.
4113,Michael,"No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody ""faggie"". Why would anybody find that offensive?"
4114,Michael,That's what faggie means!
4115,Michael,"It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!"
4116,Michael,"OK, a little too far, crossed the line."
4117,Michael,"I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people ""retards"". It's bad taste. You call your friends ""retards"" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend."
4118,Michael,"Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea."
4119,Michael,"No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people ""faggie"" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
4120,Oscar,"That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that."
4121,Angela, It explains so much.
4122,Oscar,"No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if...  Uh... yeah I'm gay."
4123,Jim,"I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable."
4124,Jim,Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right?
4125,Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right?"
4126,Jim,"Uh-huh, yeah. I am."
4127,Andy,She's pretty hot huh?  She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.
4128,Jim,"I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name."
4129,Andy,"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?  I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, ""Here Comes Treble."""
4130,Jim,"Oh, I can do that."
4131,Michael,Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
4132,Dwight,"Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so..."
4133,Michael, There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
4134,Dwight,"You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive."
4135,Michael,"Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay."
4136,Michael,"Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman."
4137,Dwight,I really don't think so.
4138,Michael,"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?"
4139,Michael,Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
4140,Dwight,Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
4141,Dwight,Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.
4142,Michael, Let's call him and get the website.
4143,Michael,"Well, they're sold out."
4144,Dwight,Damn.  I'll try Brookstone.
4145,Pam,"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks."
4146,Oscar,"Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan."
4147,Angela,"Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented."
4148,Andy,"OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!"
4149,Michael,"I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so..."
4150,Michael,What? What does that even...
4151,Michael,"Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival."
4152,Michael,I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?
4153,Michael," Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!"
4154,Michael,"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
4155,Oscar,Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
4156,Michael,"Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?"
4157,Pam,"Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer."
4158,Dwight,"Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons."
4159,Michael," Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful."
4160,Oscar,What are you doing?!
4161,Angela,Watching some of your friends.
4162,Michael," All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!"
4163,Michael,"Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men."
4164,Michael,"We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you."
4165,Oscar,"Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?"
4166,Michael,Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
4167,Michael,"Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?"
4168,Kevin,/b]: That sounds great.
4169,Dwight,"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them."
4170,Oscar,No one else in this office is gay.
4171,Dwight,What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
4172,Michael,"That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  See? Everybody has a chance!"
4173,Michael,"But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!"
4174,Michael, Right!  And I take that as a compliment.
4175,Michael,"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---"
4176,Oscar,You sound pretty defensive Michael.
4177,Michael,"No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!"
4178,Michael,"Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag."
4179,Oscar,"I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life."
4180,Michael,"You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---"
4181,Oscar,I would rather not.
4182,Michael,"...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!"
4183,Oscar,"No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!"
4184,Michael,"All right, um... sorry."
4185,Oscar,"Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on. "
4186,Michael, I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.
4187,Dwight,Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.
4188,Michael,"You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here. "
4189,Michael," Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!"
4190,Michael,"We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?"
4191,Michael,"I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said."
4192,Michael,"Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?"
4193,Oscar,"I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay."
4194,Dwight," ""Hope this helps. -Jim"" Nice!"
4195,Oscar, What are you doing?!
4196,Dwight,Shhh. Don't be scared.  It works.  ...oh no.
4197,Michael,Did you see Oprah yesterday?
4198,Michael,"I, uh... I am going to be a father."
4199,Pam,What was Oprah about?
4200,Michael,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost."
4201,Pam,That's a really big decision.
4202,Pam,Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
4203,Michael,"Just do it, okay?"
4204,Pam,"Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars."
4205,Michael,"Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?"
4206,Pam,"You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months."
4207,Michael,I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
4208,Michael,"You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby..."
4209,Ryan,All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
4210,Michael,"Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled s*x romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo."
4211,Dwight,"Don't be mad, it is a business trip."
4212,Angela,But I don't understand. It's for managers.
4213,Dwight,"Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager."
4214,Angela,I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together.  Are you still there?
4215,Angela,"Don't ""Monkey"" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M."
4216,Angela,"In the Martin family, we like to say, ""Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly."" That's code for ""check out the slut."" What is... why are there flies in here?"
4217,Pam,"Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that."
4218,Michael,"Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?"
4219,Michael,"Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker."
4220,Pam,I'll probably just wear this.
4221,Michael,"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?"
4222,Angela,"That was for per diem, for Philadelphia."
4223,Angela,That town is full of history!
4224,Dwight,Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
4225,Michael,"Hey, Josh, how ya doing?"
4226,Michael,"Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns."
4227,Michael,"I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut."
4228,Jim,"It's really good to see you, man."
4229,Michael,"Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!"
4230,Dwight,"Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?"
4231,Jim,"Yeah, sold about forty thousand."
4232,Dwight,Shut up. That's impossible.
4233,Jim,"No, it's not. I did. Yep."
4234,Dwight,"Well, I did it too."
4235,Jim,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key."
4236,Kevin,So did you hear?
4237,Kevin,Pam's back on the market again.
4238,Kevin,"If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that."
4239,Dwight,So what kind of commissions you get up there?
4240,Jim,"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much."
4241,Michael,"Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules."
4242,Michael,"The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention."
4243,Michael,Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
4244,Dwight,This party is going to be awesome.
4245,Michael,I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
4246,Michael,That is crooked on that side.
4247,Jim,That is a lot of liquor.
4248,Jim,And a dart board.
4249,Michael,"Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop."
4250,Michael,"Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?"
4251,Jim,"Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there."
4252,Michael,Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
4253,Michael,"All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up."
4254,Dwight,"I'll do a shot, Michael."
4255,Michael,"Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet."
4256,Michael,SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
4257,Michael,"Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin."
4258,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin."
4259,Dwight,I'm a huge fan.
4260,Michael,"You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come."
4261,Michael,"Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?"
4262,Michael,So maybe. See ya.
4263,Dwight,Why do they call him The Bus?
4264,Michael,Because he's afraid to fly.
4265,Michael,"Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!"
4266,Michael,"Yep. Yeah, she's up front."
4267,Dwight,You don't have email on your phone.
4268,Michael,"I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?"
4269,Dwight,No one just called you.
4270,Jim,"All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care."
4271,Michael, See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please?
4272,Michael,I need you to do something for me.
4273,Michael,I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
4274,Dwight,"I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat."
4275,Pam," Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. What's up?"
4276,Pam,"Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here."
4277,Dwight,"So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera."
4278,Dwight,He wasn't volunteering today.
4279,Michael,Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
4280,Michael,Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
4281,Jim,"Oh, tell him I say hi."
4282,Michael,I will call him later with that message.
4283,Jim,"Hey, how is... Toby?"
4284,Michael,Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
4285,Jim,"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to..."
4286,Michael,"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically."
4287,Jim,"Michael, it's really not a competition."
4288,Michael,"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip."
4289,Dwight,Was that your per diem?
4290,Michael,"No, that was a different hundred dollar bill."
4291,Michael,I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
4292,Michael,"The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited."
4293,Angela,Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
4294,Michael,Any messages for 308? All right.
4295,Michael,"Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton."
4296,Michael,"Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend."
4297,Dwight,Keep the wing flaps.
4298,Michael,"Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!"
4299,Michael,"Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye."
4300,Dwight,"Come on. Nice try, Josh!"
4301,Michael,"Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing."
4302,Michael,"Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work."
4303,Michael,"Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for."
4304,Michael,"Sorry, my meeting ran late."
4305,Michael,"Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill."
4306,Michael,Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
4307,Michael,"Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me."
4308,Jim,Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
4309,Jim,"Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!"
4310,Ryan,I don't want ketchup.
4311,Pam,So how do you come up with your cartoons?
4312,Pam,You dream in cartoons? How fun!
4313,Michael,"Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend."
4314,Michael,This is the party.
4315,Michael,"Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right."
4316,Pam,"Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan."
4317,Pam,"I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know."
4318,Jim,Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
4319,Michael,People have been filtering in and out.
4320,Jim,Can I get a drink?
4321,Jim,Can I get a drink?
4322,Michael,Sure. You like Cosmos?
4323,Michael,"Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?"
4324,Michael,"I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just..."
4325,Jim,"Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss."
4326,Michael,I'm not better than Josh.
4327,Jim,"Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam."
4328,Michael,Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
4329,Jim,"No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice."
4330,Michael,"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her."
4331,Michael,"I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling."
4332,Michael,"Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out."
4333,Michael,"Evan, this is Jim."
4334,Michael,"Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?"
4335,Jim,"No, we used to. Now we're friends."
4336,Michael,"Some people need dozens of friends to say, ""Hey, look at me, I'm popular."" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly."
4337,Michael,"Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha."
4338,Dwight,"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
4339,Michael,Whoa. What are those stains?
4340,Dwight,"Blood, urine, or semen."
4341,Michael,"Oh, God, I hope it's urine."
4342,Michael,Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
4343,Michael,"Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
4344,Dwight, Take a seat down there. Second from the end.
4345,Michael,"Alright, everybody here? Yes."
4346,Michael,Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!
4347,Pam,"Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times."
4348,Michael,"Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?"
4349,Michael,Don't whine. Get the window. 
4350,Michael,Previously on Varsity Blues...
4351,Kevin,"Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year..."
4352,Dwight,Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.
4353,Angela,I don't approve. I don't.
4354,Michael, Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
4355,Michael,People work faster after...
4356,Michael,No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
4357,Angela,"Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs."
4358,Dwight,That's not going to happen.
4359,Angela,You know she has it out for him now.
4360,Dwight,That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!
4361,Dwight,"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms."
4362,Angela,"Dwight, you should be running this office."
4363,Dwight,Michael would never let me...
4364,Angela,"It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her."
4365,Dwight,I could never do that!
4366,Angela,Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
4367,Angela,"I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair."
4368,Jim,"At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus."
4369,Pam," Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. "
4370,Pam,"Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes."
4371,Pam,Really? I don't know.
4372,Pam,"Not at work, I'll try it on---"
4373,Andy,Why did you do that?!
4374,Jim,"I'm just killing Germans, any way I can."
4375,Andy,We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish.
4376,Jim," Wait, are we playing teams?"
4377,Dwight,This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
4378,Dwight, I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.
4379,Dwight,"No, but we should discuss that another time."
4380,Dwight,"Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you."
4381,Dwight,Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
4382,Dwight,Part of my job.
4383,Dwight, I'm going... to the dentist.
4384,Dwight,I have to have an emergency crown put in.
4385,Dwight,Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.
4386,Michael,"Three hours, wow. Have fun. "
4387,Dwight,Did you get anything good?
4388,Dwight,New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?
4389,Dwight,I can save the branch.
4390,Dwight,If you let me run it.
4391,Dwight," ""Ok"" I can run it?"
4392,Dwight,Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house.  Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.
4393,Dwight,"The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So , here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision."
4394,Dwight," Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings."
4395,Michael,...you were at the dentist?
4396,Michael,What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.
4397,Pam,I'm gonna return it.
4398,Jim,"Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  Ok, see you next week. Bye.  Again?"
4399,Andy,Put the game on hold everyone.
4400,Andy,It's the new guy. 
4401,Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about..."
4402,Andy,See what I mean?
4403,Andy,Are you playing for the other team?!
4404,Andy,Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you.
4405,Michael,Do you want an M&M?
4406,Dwight,No thanks I'm stuffed.
4407,Michael,"No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good."
4408,Michael,Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
4409,Dwight,"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so..."
4410,Michael,Sounds like a good dentist.
4411,Michael,Your dentist's name is Crentist.
4412,Michael,Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
4413,Dwight,Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
4414,Michael,Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.
4415,Michael, Well then... I am glad you're ok.
4416,Michael,"Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology."
4417,Michael,"Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?"
4418,Michael," Wow, this is tough."
4419,Michael,"Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me."
4420,Michael,Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
4421,Michael,"And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton."
4422,Dwight,I can't believe this news. That--- wow.
4423,Michael,I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
4424,Michael,"Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it."
4425,Dwight,"Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will."
4426,Michael," Perfect, well, we're settled."
4427,Michael,"All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager."
4428,Dwight,"Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it."
4429,Dwight,Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
4430,Michael, Can't you? That's so nice.
4431,Michael,Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
4432,Dwight,"Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.  Ok let's do it."
4433,Michael,"Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight."
4434,Michael,"You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that."
4435,Michael,"Because, Dwight... never lies."
4436,Michael,Because that's all it takes.
4437,Michael,"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?"
4438,Dwight,"Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!"
4439,Michael,"Oh, I'll be fine."
4440,Kevin,Do you have any savings?
4441,Michael,"No, no, I don't, but---"
4442,Kevin,"Michael, you might lose your condo."
4443,Michael,I... won't. I won't.
4444,Pam,"I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager."
4445,Angela,We can make a difference here.
4446,Angela,You alone? Because I thought together we could---
4447,Dwight,"Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women."
4448,Jim,I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
4449,Pam,Please go back to your desk.
4450,Pam,"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas."
4451,Michael,"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring."
4452,Michael,"It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it."
4453,Michael,But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
4454,Dwight,"Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate."
4455,Michael,"I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know."
4456,Michael,Jan called me about your little meeting!
4457,Michael,"I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight."
4458,Dwight,I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.
4459,Michael,"Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?"
4460,Dwight, Don't fire me. Please.
4461,Michael,Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
4462,Dwight, I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
4463,Dwight, I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!
4464,Michael,I have a laundry machine!
4465,Dwight,"I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear. "
4466,Michael,I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
4467,Dwight,"You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do? What can I do?"
4468,Michael,"You can get up. Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch. "
4469,Michael,"Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate."
4470,Michael,"Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I'm making him do my laundry for a year."
4471,Michael,"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?"
4472,Ryan,"Uh, no thanks, I'm good."
4473,Michael,"Oh, it's okay, I'm going down."
4474,Michael,"All right, I'll be right back. "
4475,Dwight,"Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?"
4476,Michael,Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. 
4477,Michael,"There you go, fresh from the warehouse."
4478,Pam,"Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?"
4479,Michael,"There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam."
4480,Pam,But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
4481,Michael,I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.
4482,Pam, With cream and sugar?
4483,Michael,"Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?"
4484,Michael,"Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died."
4485,Michael,"Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss."
4486,Michael,"That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up."
4487,Michael,So did you hear the news?
4488,Pam,The news that you just announced? That Ed died?
4489,Pam,Is there anything I can do?
4490,Michael,"Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life."
4491,Andy," Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said?"
4492,Jim,"Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please."
4493,Michael,Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.
4494,Michael,"The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that."
4495,Dwight,That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.
4496,Dwight,You're thinking of a chicken.
4497,Michael,"That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him."
4498,Michael," So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this..."
4499,Michael,What are you doing?
4500,Dwight,You said you didn't know how to say it.
4501,Michael,I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
4502,Dwight,"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice."
4503,Angela,I do not wanna talk about this.
4504,Dwight,"When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in."
4505,Michael,"I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here."
4506,Michael,"You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off."
4507,Michael,"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him."
4508,Michael,"We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move..."
4509,Dwight,"That is not a statue, that is a robot."
4510,Michael,I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
4511,Dwight,And how big do you want this robot?
4512,Dwight,"Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us."
4513,Michael,"Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan."
4514,Michael,Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
4515,Michael,But Ed truck can't because he is---
4516,Dwight,Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
4517,Jim,"Okay, that is a ""no"" on the on the West Side Market."
4518,Jim,Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.
4519,Andy,Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.
4520,Jim,"Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen."
4521,Andy,Did you check the vending machine?
4522,Jim,I have no idea. We went right for the copier.
4523,Jim,And then we checked the fax machine.
4524,Andy,Did you check your... butt?
4525,Michael,"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam."
4526,Michael,"Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!"
4527,Michael,"Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!"
4528,Michael,"There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job."
4529,Michael,"I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone."
4530,Michael,"Okay, fine. Hurry back."
4531,Pam,Oh. I would like a break.
4532,Pam,"I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders."
4533,Jim," Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back.  Shut up ."
4534,Michael," Okay, we can start. Um..."
4535,Pam,You waited for me?
4536,Michael,"Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?"
4537,Dwight," I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby."
4538,Michael,"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else."
4539,Michael," Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go."
4540,Michael,Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
4541,Pam,"Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die."
4542,Michael,"Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay."
4543,Ryan," Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened."
4544,Michael,Do you want to talk about it anymore?
4545,Ryan,"Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story."
4546,Kevin,"Me, me, me, me, me me.  Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so..."
4547,Michael,Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game?
4548,Michael,"All right, we're starting over."
4549,Michael,You are not leaving. No! We are not done.
4550,Angela,We really have a lot of work to do right now.
4551,Michael,"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. "
4552,Michael,How do you know?
4553,Michael,That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?
4554,Michael,"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! "
4555,Dwight,Michael!  Michael. Michael ...
4556,Michael,"Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ..."
4557,Dwight,He is a goner.
4558,Dwight,"Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!"
4559,Michael,"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!"
4560,Angela,A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
4561,Michael,We don't know if it's dead.
4562,Dwight,You want me to flush him?
4563,Michael,Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
4564,Michael,"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it."
4565,Michael,"No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him."
4566,Michael,"It's okay. It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show."
4567,Michael,What are... What are you doing?
4568,Dwight,"What? No, this is about the right size."
4569,Michael,"No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?"
4570,Dwight,"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.  It would have fit if he had given me another minute."
4571,Dwight,I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.
4572,Pam,Is it for the bird?
4573,Pam,I have it covered. 
4574,Pam,If you wanna do something for the funeral...
4575,Pam,Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
4576,Pam,Do you have it with you?
4577,Pam,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.
4578,Jim,Where'd I find what?
4579,Jim,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door."
4580,Michael,Glad you could all make it.
4581,Michael,"Dwight, do you have the box?"
4582,Pam,"Actually, I have it."
4583,Michael,You made this? Wow.  That's... that's very nice.
4584,Pam,I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
4585,Pam,"What do we know about this bird? You might think, ""Not much. It's just a bird."" But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above."
4586,Kevin,"Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny."
4587,Pam,"And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song."
4588,Dwight,He's not a songbird.
4589,Pam,"An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten."
4590,Pam, Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
4591,Michael,"Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown."
4592,Dwight,Let's get back to work.
4593,Dwight,Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
4594,Ryan,A dime and a nickel.
4595,Dwight,"No, I said one of them is not a nickel."
4596,Ryan,But the other one is. I've heard that before.
4597,Dwight,"Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ..."
4598,Ryan,Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
4599,Dwight,A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
4600,Ryan,"He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted."
4601,Ryan,It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
4602,Michael,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?"
4603,Michael,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?"
4604,Michael,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?
4605,Michael,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base."
4606,Pam,"Oh, I don't know if I'm..."
4607,Pam,"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five."
4608,Ryan,Yes. I'm very excited.
4609,Dwight,Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.
4610,Ryan,"I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited."
4611,Dwight,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?"
4612,Ryan,"So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?  So where's the sales office?"
4613,Dwight,"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now."
4614,Jim,"No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair."
4615,Jim,So I guess I can't get up.
4616,Michael,"Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too."
4617,Dwight,"Do you know where we are, temp?"
4618,Ryan,I know where we're not.
4619,Dwight,"I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it.  AH!  When... Damn it."
4620,Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second."
4621,Andy,Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
4622,Andy,I'm acting my heart out here.
4623,Andy,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped."
4624,Pam,Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
4625,Michael,"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me."
4626,Michael," Oh, shhh... Come on."
4627,Dwight,"And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you."
4628,Ryan,I don't think you know what you're saying.
4629,Dwight,"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?"
4630,Dwight,It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
4631,Dwight,"Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back."
4632,Michael," Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?"
4633,Michael,"No, I think you're cutting in line."
4634,Michael,"No, I'm not going to settle down."
4635,Michael,Get in the back please.
4636,Michael,Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right.
4637,Ryan,"Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship."
4638,Dwight,Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
4639,Jim," Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,"
4640,Jim,"Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me"
4641,Jim,"fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,"
4642,Jim,"Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me."
4643,Andy,I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
4644,Michael,"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind."
4645,Pam,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
4646,Michael,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
4647,Pam,"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel."
4648,Michael,"Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown."
4649,Pam,"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today."
4650,Michael,"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back."
4651,Dwight,It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
4652,Ryan,"Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it."
4653,Dwight,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
4654,Michael,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
4655,Michael,"Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?"
4656,Michael,All right! Thank you!
4657,Dwight,Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
4658,Ryan,Is that your Cousin Mose?
4659,Dwight,"Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore."
4660,Dwight,What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
4661,Ryan,Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
4662,Dwight,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
4663,Dwight,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
4664,Angela,Sales take a long time.
4665,Angela,I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
4666,Angela,"He's not weird, he's just individualistic."
4667,Dwight,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?"
4668,Ryan,"Um, loneliness. Maybe women."
4669,Dwight,"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose."
4670,Ryan,No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.
4671,Dwight,Wrestle him to the ground.
4672,Ryan,"No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye."
4673,Dwight,Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
4674,Dwight,Where are all the animals?
4675,Dwight,"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled."
4676,Dwight,"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams."
4677,Ryan,"Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call."
4678,Dwight,Screwgun. The sales call!
4679,Michael,"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?"
4680,Dwight,"Establish time frames. Keep the phrase ""real dollars"" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much."
4681,Ryan,"Wait, can you go back?"
4682,Dwight,"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time."
4683,Ryan,"Ok, I'm going to establish time frames."
4684,Ryan,"I'm going to put everything in terms of ""real dollars""."
4685,Ryan,I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
4686,Ryan,"Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing."
4687,Ryan,"I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky."
4688,Michael,"Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second..."
4689,Michael,"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you."
4690,Kevin,"Account...? Michael, what is going on?"
4691,Michael,And I will be taking questions.
4692,Pam,"Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?"
4693,Michael,"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!"
4694,Ryan,They really didn't like me.
4695,Dwight,They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
4696,Ryan,I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
4697,Dwight,"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing?  Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive."
4698,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan."
4699,Dwight," Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere."
4700,Ryan,I think about that all the time.
4701,Michael,"Hey, what time is it?"
4702,Pam,These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
4703,Michael,Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
4704,Pam,This is a huge sale.
4705,Jim,"Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing."
4706,Jim,"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?"
4707,Pam,I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
4708,Jim,Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
4709,Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead."
4710,Pam,"Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here."
4711,Pam,A little different. What time is it there?
4712,Jim,"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone."
4713,Jim,How far away did you think we were?
4714,Pam,I don't know. It felt far.
4715,Jim,Yeah. I have a question for you.
4716,Jim,How many words per minute does the average person type?
4717,Jim,Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
4718,Jim,"Ok, I said average."
4719,Pam,70? How many do you type?
4720,Jim,Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
4721,Pam,Come on. Tell me.
4722,Pam,You have to tell me now.
4723,Jim,"65. Ok, no need to laugh."
4724,Pam,"No, it's, that's respectable."
4725,Pam,"So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself..."
4726,Pam,Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
4727,Pam,"And, I'm freaking out."
4728,Pam,That movie is so scary!
4729,Pam,But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
4730,Jim,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
4731,Pam,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
4732,Jim,"No, you're making this up!"
4733,Pam,Would I make that up?
4734,Jim,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories."
4735,Pam,"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet."
4736,Jim,And how many kitchens?
4737,Pam,I have one kitchen.
4738,Jim,"Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley."
4739,Jim,Most apartments these days have like three.
4740,Jim,Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
4741,Pam," Hey, Ryan, are you ok?"
4742,Jim,"Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too."
4743,Pam,"No, I was um..."
4744,Pam,You have to go?
4745,Pam,"No, I should probably go too."
4746,Michael,"Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween."
4747,Pam,Really you do. I love the material.
4748,Michael,How come you didn't get me one?
4749,Pam,I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
4750,Pam,"Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet."
4751,Pam,"I just feel kind of tired, you know."
4752,Dwight,Maybe you've got mono.
4753,Pam,Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
4754,Dwight,"Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available."
4755,Kevin,Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
4756,Kevin,"Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?"
4757,Angela,Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
4758,Michael,Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
4759,Michael,"It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby."
4760,Michael,Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
4761,Michael,"I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol."
4762,Michael,"Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on."
4763,Michael,Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
4764,Angela,How many gods do you have?
4765,Angela, And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
4766,Kevin,She looks like Pam from the neck down.
4767,Dwight,"Pam wishes.  Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil..."
4768,Michael,"All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'."
4769,Jim,"I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work."
4770,Michael,"Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '"
4771,Dwight,I see dead people.
4772,Dwight,He was dead the whole time.
4773,Michael,"Just stop it.  What's the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from?"
4774,Andy,"We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I."
4775,Andy,Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
4776,Michael,And another thing about the Indian people... they love s*x positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
4777,Kevin,This is the best meeting we've ever had.
4778,Angela,I find this incredibly offensive.
4779,Michael,"Well, I find it beautiful."
4780,Angela,"Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it."
4781,Michael,"No, You're not going to collect them."
4782,Michael,"No. This is delightful, charming culture."
4783,Michael,My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just s*x. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
4784,Jim,"Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds."
4785,Andy,You guys ready to party?
4786,Andy,I said are you ready TO PARTY!
4787,Angela,I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
4788,Kevin,Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
4789,Michael, What does that look like to you?
4790,Michael,No one's even going to notice.
4791,Michael,"Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol."
4792,Michael,"I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions..."
4793,Angela,I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
4794,Angela,I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
4795,Michael,No. These s'mores are disgusting.
4796,Michael,Do you think they have any s'mores?
4797,Michael,"All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?"
4798,Ryan,"So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?"
4799,Ryan,They said something about Zach Braff.
4800,Pam,"I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?"
4801,Dwight,Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
4802,Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?"
4803,Andy,One. Two. Three. Shot!
4804,Jim,"Oh, Holy Mother of God."
4805,Andy,"Oh, that burns! Golly. Um..."
4806,Michael,"Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?"
4807,Michael,"Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!"
4808,Michael,"She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!"
4809,Andy,One. Two. Three. Shot!
4810,Michael,"I'm going to be.  Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband."
4811,Michael,What do you say?
4812,Michael,I didn't hear you. 
4813,Michael," Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay."
4814,Michael,No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
4815,Michael,"Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much."
4816,Michael,"Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra."
4817,Michael,All right. Good night.
4818,Ryan,"Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive."
4819,Ryan,"Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox."
4820,Pam,Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
4821,Pam,"Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?"
4822,Pam,It's hot in there. How's the naan?
4823,Angela,Dry. You look like you were having fun.
4824,Pam,I am. You should come dance with us.
4825,Angela,I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
4826,Andy, I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
4827,Andy," I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain."
4828,Andy,TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
4829,Michael,"Oh, God!  Oh. Wow."
4830,Michael,Oh. You waiting for a call?
4831,Michael,"Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements."
4832,Pam,"Well, you were never really engaged."
4833,Michael,"I was in that marriage arena, though."
4834,Pam,I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
4835,Michael,We're so alike. So alike. 
4836,Pam,What are you doing?
4837,Michael,What are you doing?
4838,Michael,I'm... what? I didn't
4839,Michael, Can I have a ride home?
4840,Pam,If you sit in the back.
4841,Jim,"Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike."
4842,Andy,"No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin."
4843,Jim,I'm a drunk driver.
4844,Jim,"Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli."
4845,Jim,"No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right."
4846,Michael,These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
4847,Pam,You say one more word
4848,Michael,"This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!"
4849,Jim,"Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain."
4850,Jim,"I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  ""Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."""
4851,Dwight,No! You'll thank me later.
4852,Michael,There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
4853,Michael,...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
4854,Michael," Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby."
4855,Michael,Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
4856,Michael,"Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up."
4857,Michael,"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?"
4858,Michael,"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?"
4859,Michael,"It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm."
4860,Michael,Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.
4861,Michael,Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
4862,Dwight,Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
4863,Michael,"Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can."
4864,Jim,Really? Wow... that's bad.
4865,Andy,"Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing?  In your face!"
4866,Jim,"Well, I work here now."
4867,Michael,"Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life."
4868,Pam,What did Jan want?
4869,Michael,"Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so..."
4870,Pam,What can't you tell me?
4871,Michael,"Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway."
4872,Pam,You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
4873,Michael,Do I have any messages?
4874,Pam,"Michael, what's going on?"
4875,Michael," Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down."
4876,Michael,"You knew about this all along, didn't you?"
4877,Michael,Traitor. You are a traitor.
4878,Angela,"What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?"
4879,Michael,I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
4880,Ryan,It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
4881,Angela,I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
4882,Andy," Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!"
4883,Jim,"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans."
4884,Pam,"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, ""Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."" So, maybe that'll stop now."
4885,Kevin,"Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut."
4886,Darryl,"Look, I heard about the office. Tough break."
4887,Michael,"I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me."
4888,Michael,"So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and..."
4889,Darryl,"Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good."
4890,Michael,This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
4891,Michael,"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Let's go."
4892,Pam,"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight."
4893,Michael,Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
4894,Michael,"Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch."
4895,Michael,No. There's no one else.
4896,Dwight,"Thank you very much.  Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office."
4897,Dwight,"But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here."
4898,Michael,You sent him cards? You never met him.
4899,Dwight,"But when I do, we'll have something to talk about."
4900,Jim,"Hey, do you have a second?"
4901,Jim,"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?"
4902,Jim,"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?"
4903,Jim,What does that mean?
4904,Ryan," I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense."
4905,Ryan,"This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best."
4906,Michael,"Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like ""Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person."" It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else."
4907,Jim,"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that."
4908,Dwight,"So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?"
4909,Michael,I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
4910,Dwight,"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice."
4911,Dwight," Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work."
4912,Dwight,Yes? What is the meaning of this?
4913,Dwight,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents."
4914,Michael,"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings."
4915,Dwight,"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business."
4916,Michael," Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that."
4917,Dwight," Whoa hey, why not?"
4918,Michael,"Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?"
4919,Michael,Don't touch me this time.
4920,Dwight," Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work..."
4921,Michael,"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?"
4922,Jim,"No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um..."
4923,Jim,"No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think."
4924,Kevin,Where are we going?
4925,Angela,I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
4926,Kevin,How 'bout Cooper's then?
4927,Kevin,"But, I don't want to go to DJ's."
4928,Angela,"Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?"
4929,Dwight,"Ah.  Here, replinish your fluids."
4930,Pam,He's not here. I don't know where he is.
4931,Pam,Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
4932,Pam,"Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?"
4933,Pam,Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
4934,Michael,"No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news."
4935,Pam,I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
4936,Ryan,Is Jim coming back.
4937,Pam,"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh."
4938,Ryan,"I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk."
4939,Pam,"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?"
4940,Jim,I really don't know. How you doing with all this?
4941,Jim,You'd actually move to Scranton?
4942,Jim,New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
4943,Andy,"Thanks, man. You, too. Totally."
4944,Michael,What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
4945,Dwight,Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
4946,Michael," All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go."
4947,Dwight,My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
4948,Michael,That was hilarious. The foam ...
4949,Dwight,"Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me."
4950,Michael,"Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good."
4951,Dwight,What were your favorite moments?
4952,Michael,"Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one."
4953,Dwight,What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
4954,Kevin,"Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots."
4955,Pam,Really? Where did you hear that?
4956,Kevin," Hey Ryan, you coming?"
4957,Ryan,"Uh yeah, we'll meet you there."
4958,Kevin,"Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis."
4959,Pam,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay."
4960,Jim,"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it."
4961,Michael,What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
4962,Michael,"Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!"
4963,Michael,We did it? We did it.
4964,Michael,Right here! Right here! 
4965,Michael,How did we do it?
4966,Dwight,I don't ... have no idea.
4967,Jim,The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
4968,Andy," That's the other thing you got to watch out...  Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott."
4969,Andy,So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
4970,Jim,You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
4971,Andy,"Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you."
4972,Jim,"Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?"
4973,Pam,How'd the run go?
4974,Dwight,"Psh, why is that great?"
4975,Pam,Because he accomplished something.
4976,Dwight,What was your mile time?
4977,Dwight, I could beat that on a skateboard.
4978,Dwight,"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time."
4979,Pam,"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?"
4980,Dwight,Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
4981,Dwight,I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
4982,Dwight,"Man, what is taking Toby so long?"
4983,Pam,"Oh, I'll just time him later."
4984,Dwight,And you'll compare the times?
4985,Pam,Yeah. Are you ready?
4986,Pam,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby."
4987,Pam,I should probably get back to work.
4988,Michael,Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
4989,Dwight,Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
4990,Michael,"My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. "
4991,Dwight,If I were you...
4992,Dwight,...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
4993,Michael,I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
4994,Dwight,"No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner."
4995,Dwight,The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
4996,Michael,"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league."
4997,Pam,"Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back."
4998,Michael,Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
4999,Michael,Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
5000,Michael,"You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned,  this says 'World's Best Dad'."
5001,Michael,Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
5002,Michael,Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
5003,Kevin,"Michael, I didn't get a gift bag."
5004,Michael,"Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later."
5005,Michael,"Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy."
5006,Kevin,Can I have your pencils?
5007,Pam,"Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me."
5008,Michael,"Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader."
5009,Michael,"Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?"
5010,Andy,"I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs."
5011,Michael,Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
5012,Andy,And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
5013,Michael,"A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you."
5014,Andy,"Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike."
5015,Michael,They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
5016,Michael,You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
5017,Michael," No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man."
5018,Michael," How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you."
5019,Michael,"Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is..."
5020,Jim,"Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here."
5021,Pam,Oh my god! It's really you!
5022,Jim,"Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met..."
5023,Pam,I know. I don't care.
5024,Jim,Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
5025,Pam,It's really good to see you.
5026,Jim,"Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand."
5027,Dwight,"Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford."
5028,Dwight,Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
5029,Dwight,What are you doing?
5030,Jim,I don't know what you're talking about.
5031,Dwight,I have a smudge on my forehead?
5032,Dwight,Why are you looking at my forehead?
5033,Dwight,"Meet my eye line, Jim!"
5034,Dwight,Stop acting like an idiot!
5035,Ryan,"Hey, buddy. Welcome back."
5036,Jim,Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
5037,Ryan,I'm good! How are you? So...
5038,Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?"
5039,Ryan,"Um... unless you really, really want it back."
5040,Jim,"You know, man, it's really you're call."
5041,Jim, Let me get that for you.
5042,Jim,This one taken? No. Good.
5043,Ryan,Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
5044,Kevin,"Oh, yes I can."
5045,Kevin,"In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need."
5046,Andy,"Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike."
5047,Dwight,Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
5048,Andy,Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
5049,Dwight,"So you'll be reporting to me, then."
5050,Andy,"Umm, on the contrary."
5051,Dwight,My title has 'Manager' in it.
5052,Andy,And I'm a director.
5053,Andy,Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
5054,Dwight,I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
5055,Jim,"How are you, man?"
5056,Jim,I just wanted to say hi.
5057,Jim,Oh. Is that like your new thing?
5058,Jim,All right. Good to be back.
5059,Kevin,This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh!  Shoot.
5060,Michael, I present the orientation video.
5061,Dwight,We need to talk!
5062,Dwight,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
5063,Michael,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
5064,Dwight,Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
5065,Michael,"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one."
5066,Dwight,Ok. Who reports to who?
5067,Michael,"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?"
5068,Dwight,And then if I want...
5069,Michael,Work it out amongst your selves!
5070,Michael,"Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?"
5071,Jim,Great. What's new with you?
5072,Michael,"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!"
5073,Michael,"Nope, no. Guests only."
5074,Michael,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo."
5075,Michael,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy."
5076,Kevin,The beef is poisoned?
5077,Michael,"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself."
5078,Michael,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please."
5079,Jim,"Oh, this looks promising."
5080,Pam,You won't be disappointed.
5081,Michael,"Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch ""Lazy Scranton""."
5082,Michael,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'."
5083,Dwight,"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty."
5084,Michael,So check out how we live
5085,Michael,They call it Scranton.
5086,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton.
5087,Michael,The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
5088,Dwight,But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
5089,Jim,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
5090,Michael, I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
5091,Michael,"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,"
5092,Dwight,But the little cars go in the compact spot
5093,Michael, Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
5094,Michael,"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'."
5095,Jim,"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian."
5096,Andy,"Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?"
5097,Dwight,Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
5098,Andy,"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm."
5099,Andy,"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver."
5100,Andy,Do you like it?
5101,Angela,"I do like it, actually."
5102,Andy,Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
5103,Pam,What happened to grape soda?
5104,Jim,Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
5105,Pam,Oh. You've changed so much.
5106,Jim,"Well, I'm evolving, Pam."
5107,Pam,So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
5108,Jim,"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled."
5109,Pam,"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever."
5110,Michael,Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
5111,Jim,Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
5112,Jim,All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
5113,Pam,"Yeah. I know, me too."
5114,Pam,"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good."
5115,Ryan,"I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting."
5116,Michael,What is that? A squid's eye or...
5117,Michael,People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
5118,Michael,"I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just."
5119,Dwight,Do you have batteries?
5120,Andy,"Baby, don't hurt me."
5121,Michael,"Okay, here we go."
5122,Andy,"Baby, don't hurt me!"
5123,Michael,Scuse me! Scuse me!
5124,Michael,You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
5125,Michael,"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!"
5126,Andy,"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy."
5127,Michael," Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor."
5128,Michael,"All right, all right, I'm on a roll."
5129,Michael,Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
5130,Michael,Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
5131,Michael,I understand. We're all friends.
5132,Michael,"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up."
5133,Michael,You know what? I'll help. I will...
5134,Michael,Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
5135,Dwight,Do this. Come on. Ready?
5136,Michael,Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
5137,Dwight,On three. One... two... three.
5138,Michael,"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here."
5139,Michael,We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
5140,Michael,I'm right in your crack!
5141,Michael,"You've got it, you've got it."
5142,Michael,Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
5143,Michael,"Well, we'll squeeze you in."
5144,Michael,"You can't quit! On the first day. That's  heresy, my friend!  Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?"
5145,Michael,My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
5146,Michael,"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired."
5147,Michael,"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!"
5148,Michael,"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you."
5149,Dwight,That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
5150,Michael,"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight."
5151,Dwight,And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
5152,Andy,Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
5153,Angela,Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
5154,Michael,"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide."
5155,Michael,No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
5156,Michael,"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it."
5157,Michael,"Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires."
5158,Michael,Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
5159,Michael,"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators."
5160,Michael,"Go home, Toby. Just..."
5161,Michael,"Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  ""You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"""
5162,Michael,"No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh..."
5163,Michael,THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
5164,Ryan,Sometimes he brings more costumes.
5165,Michael,"See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!"
5166,Michael,I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
5167,Michael,But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
5168,Michael,"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos."
5169,Michael,"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two."
5170,Dwight,If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
5171,Jim,"Yeah, it does, actually."
5172,Dwight,So who will be your new Number Three?
5173,Michael,Uh... that I have not decided yet.
5174,Andy,"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb."
5175,Michael,"Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks."
5176,Dwight,And I have to say your leadership...
5177,Michael,Shut it! That's...  suck up!
5178,Jim," Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?"
5179,Jim, What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
5180,Jim,Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
5181,Jim,I thought you had already... left.
5182,Pam,Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
5183,Jim,"Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something."
5184,Pam,What do you mean?
5185,Jim,I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
5186,Pam,Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
5187,Pam,We're friends. We'll always be friends.
5188,Pam,It's good to have you back.
5189,Jim,Yeah. Good to be back.
5190,Andy,"Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?"
5191,Dwight,"Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please."
5192,Andy,"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese."
5193,Dwight,Xterra's not even a real word.
5194,Andy,"Actually, it is. It's Latin for ""earth."""
5195,Dwight,"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?"
5196,Dwight,That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
5197,Andy,"Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back."
5198,Dwight,Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
5199,Andy,"Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came."
5200,Dwight,"Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die."
5201,Andy,"Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University."
5202,Andy,"If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm."
5203,Dwight,"If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world."
5204,Dwight, I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked.  Totally got the best of that interchange.
5205,Pam,Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
5206,Pam,"...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink."
5207,Pam,...Oh. That's... fun for him.
5208,Michael,"Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute."
5209,Michael," Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from ""Look Who's Talking."" What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts."
5210,Jim,Just about... yup. Now.
5211,Jim,"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet."
5212,Michael,"Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know."
5213,Angela,"Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting."
5214,Angela,"Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means."
5215,Michael,I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding.
5216,Angela,One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
5217,Michael,"Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby."
5218,Angela,"Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?"
5219,Michael,Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
5220,Kevin,"Wait, why am I a racist?"
5221,Michael,Because you think he's black.
5222,Kevin,He is black... right? And...
5223,Michael,Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
5224,Michael,Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
5225,Kevin,I wonder what he did.
5226,Michael,"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened."
5227,Pam,Why would anyone go to jail for that?
5228,Michael,"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people."
5229,Angela,"Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that."
5230,Andy, I am so horny.
5231,Jim,...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
5232,Andy,"Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack."
5233,Jim,"She is dating Ryan, I think."
5234,Andy,"Oh, and I care why?"
5235,Andy,"Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that."
5236,Jim,"Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one."
5237,Andy,"Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?"
5238,Michael,Just... try to be cool.
5239,Michael,"Okay, are you cool, really?"
5240,Dwight,"I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on."
5241,Michael,"Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!"
5242,Dwight,"I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals."
5243,Andy,"All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?"
5244,Jim,"I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates..."
5245,Andy,I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
5246,Jim,"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?"
5247,Michael,"Hey Martin, how's it going?"
5248,Michael,"Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust."
5249,Michael,Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
5250,Michael,"Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you."
5251,Michael,No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
5252,Kevin,"I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day."
5253,Pam,What was prison like?
5254,Kevin,You got outdoors time?
5255,Kevin,"Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?"
5256,Pam,"Yeah, some days I never go outside."
5257,Michael,"Well, we are running a business, so."
5258,Pam,They have art classes?
5259,Ryan,They have business classes there?
5260,Pam,Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
5261,Michael,Ah. Well. That's not true.
5262,Kevin,I would so rather be in prison.
5263,Michael,No you would not.
5264,Michael,This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
5265,Andy,"Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?"
5266,Andy,Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
5267,Pam,Wow. That was... wow.
5268,Michael,"Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!"
5269,Pam,"Michael, it's freezing out."
5270,Michael,Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
5271,Jim,"What is that, like... five pounds?"
5272,Michael,"It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone."
5273,Michael,"Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time."
5274,Michael,Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
5275,Michael,Ah. A ten inch black and white?
5276,Michael,These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
5277,Jim,Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
5278,Jim,Quick question - do you play the guitar?
5279,Andy,I play the banjo.
5280,Jim,"Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?"
5281,Andy," You know I can, my man."
5282,Andy,I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
5283,Jim,...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
5284,Jim,"...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but..."
5285,Jim,"Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else."
5286,Michael,"All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say ""Boo"" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!"
5287,Angela,Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
5288,Michael,"Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!"
5289,Jim,Where... did you learn all of this?
5290,Michael,"And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office."
5291,Jim,"What'd you do, Prison Mike?"
5292,Michael,I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
5293,Jim,"That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike."
5294,Michael,"And I nevah got caught, neither."
5295,Jim,"Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm."
5296,Pam,Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
5297,Michael,"Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair."
5298,Andy,Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
5299,Michael,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks."
5300,Dwight,Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
5301,Angela,"Don't encourage him, Dwight."
5302,Michael,"The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!"
5303,Michael,"No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?"
5304,Pam,"Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you."
5305,Michael,"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. "
5306,Jim,"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out."
5307,Michael,"No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas."
5308,Kevin, Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
5309,Michael,"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt."
5310,Michael,"Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so."
5311,Michael," Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!"
5312,Michael,"Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black."
5313,Andy," So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee..."
5314,Pam,Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
5315,Dwight,"Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead."
5316,Dwight,I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
5317,Pam,"Well, get it out of here."
5318,Dwight,"Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?"
5319,Jim,Wow. What have we got here?
5320,Dwight,What does it look like?
5321,Dwight,And circle gets the square.
5322,Dwight, So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
5323,Dwight,"No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead."
5324,Dwight,"Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed."
5325,Dwight,"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease."
5326,Dwight,"Exactly. Thank you, Jim."
5327,Dwight,"Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas."
5328,Pam,I would like it off my desk.
5329,Dwight,Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
5330,Michael," Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  'Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint..."
5331,Pam,"Can I help you, Michael?"
5332,Michael,I'm looking for the toy drive box.
5333,Michael,"OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks."
5334,Jim,Wow. What kind of bike is that?
5335,Michael,Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
5336,Kevin,The tires look pretty worn.
5337,Michael,"Well, that is probably from the test drive."
5338,Jim,"But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?"
5339,Andy,"Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike."
5340,Michael,"Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that."
5341,Pam," I didn't, it's from corporate."
5342,Michael,OK. Did everybody get one of these?
5343,Michael,"This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah."
5344,Michael,There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. 
5345,Michael,"Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side."
5346,Michael,"Turn around, turn around. Come on. "
5347,Michael,"No, you get outta here."
5348,Andy,If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
5349,Dwight," Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her."
5350,Michael,Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
5351,Michael,"That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings."
5352,Michael,"Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart..."
5353,Michael,And next to your kids. What?
5354,Jim,"It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy.  Is bold the right word?"
5355,Michael,"No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool."
5356,Michael,"I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is."
5357,Michael,And it's all inclusive.
5358,Michael,"No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over."
5359,Pam,"Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you."
5360,Pam,For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. 
5361,Pam,"They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell."
5362,Jim," Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow."
5363,Pam,So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didn't wrap it.
5364,Jim," You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?"
5365,Jim,"No, because of the promotion."
5366,Jim,"It just feels a little bit, like..."
5367,Pam,"No, I get it, of course. OK. "
5368,Jim,"I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?"
5369,Michael,I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
5370,Michael,Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
5371,Michael,"Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley."
5372,Pam,"Michael, what's going on?"
5373,Michael,Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
5374,Jim,Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
5375,Dwight, Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
5376,Michael,Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
5377,Michael,"Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess."
5378,Michael,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts."
5379,Michael,It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
5380,Pam,"OK, well, why are you laying like that?"
5381,Michael, Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
5382,Michael,"Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?"
5383,Pam,"Well.. um I, I don't..."
5384,Michael,And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
5385,Pam,I don't need to know.
5386,Dwight,"Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short."
5387,Michael,Take it from Toby.
5388,Michael,"Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?"
5389,Angela,"Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch."
5390,Angela,"No, orange is whorish."
5391,Angela,It would never work here.
5392,Angela,"These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of ""A Nutcracker Christmas."" I think you should leave."
5393,Angela,"You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on.  Please.  Thank you. OK, thank you very much. "
5394,Michael,What are you doing? 
5395,Dwight, We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
5396,Andy,"Hey, what's the haps? "
5397,Dwight,"Oh, look at this.  Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. "
5398,Dwight,Why don't you just buy the whole song?
5399,Michael,I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
5400,Dwight,"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem.  But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie."
5401,Michael, Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. 
5402,Michael,"This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her."
5403,Pam,"I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her."
5404,Pam,"Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy."
5405,Pam,"Um, usually like that."
5406,Pam,I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. 
5407,Pam,"Um, I really liked your karaoke idea."
5408,Pam,That could really be fun.
5409,Pam,You guys do a raffle?
5410,Angela,This should've been up yesterday. 
5411,Angela," What is that?  The ""Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?"" There's no such thing as the ""Committee to Plan Parties."""
5412,Pam,There is now. We just started it.
5413,Angela,"Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding."
5414,Angela,"No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock."
5415,Kevin,Then why are there two flyers?
5416,Pam,"Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. "
5417,Kevin,I didn't see where it was.
5418,Jim,"Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?"
5419,Dwight,Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
5420,Pam,You can't do that.
5421,Dwight,"As ranking number three in this office, I am order -"
5422,Andy,Umm... I'm number three.
5423,Andy,"Yeah, but I'm number three."
5424,Dwight,"Ah, no.  You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth."
5425,Jim,"OK, I think I can help here."
5426,Jim,"As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now."
5427,Dwight,"OK, this is stupid."
5428,Jim,Could you please keep it down?  I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. 
5429,Dwight,"No no, no, wait, wait, wait  Permission to join the Validity Committee."
5430,Andy,"Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch.  C'mon, my treat."
5431,Michael,All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
5432,Andy,"That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too."
5433,Andy,"No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. "
5434,Michael,"Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters."
5435,Ryan,"Ah man, I can't."
5436,Ryan,"I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. "
5437,Michael,"C'mon Jim, let's go."
5438,Jim,"OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude."
5439,Ryan,"Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back."
5440,Michael,Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
5441,Andy,"So she looks really hot, so I said, ""You look hotter than usual today.""  Thank you. Michael  Head of the table."
5442,Dwight,"Get out Jim.  Actually, um...  Sir, I'm going to need take this chair."
5443,Michael,"Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy."
5444,Dwight,I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
5445,Michael,Carol used to drink lattes.
5446,Dwight, What're you talking about?
5447,Michael,She would get this little foam mustache...
5448,Dwight, Carol had a mustache?
5449,Michael,"And I used to say ""Hey, got latte?"" And she'd say, that's not funny."
5450,Dwight, What are you guys talking about?
5451,Michael,She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
5452,Dwight,Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
5453,Dwight,It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? 
5454,Michael,"I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out..."
5455,Dwight,Who are you calling?
5456,Michael,I'm just gonna call her.
5457,Andy,"Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here,  we need your help."
5458,Andy,I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. 
5459,Andy,"One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal."
5460,Pam,That's a great idea.
5461,Pam,You can have your snack in here.
5462,Angela,"Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis."
5463,Kevin,"I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know."
5464,Ryan,I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
5465,Pam,"If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong."
5466,Pam,"Oh, I just get those at any party supply place."
5467,Pam,"Oh yeah, your mom would love that."
5468,Dwight,Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
5469,Dwight,"Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though."
5470,Dwight,"Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better."
5471,Michael,Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
5472,Andy,"Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?"
5473,Michael,"Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. "
5474,Andy,"You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?"
5475,Michael,You're right. That's good.
5476,Pam,Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
5477,Angela,I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck! 
5478,Angela, I need to know if I can start the party?
5479,Dwight,"Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! "
5480,Michael,I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
5481,Angela,Did Michael give you permission to do this?
5482,Angela," Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now "
5483,Pam,Our party is also starting now 
5484,Angela,Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
5485,Angela,I said you wouldn't be disappointed. 
5486,Angela,"Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry."
5487,Angela,"No, it's an invitation."
5488,Kevin,I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela  Hmmm...
5489,Pam,I got goose bumps.
5490,Angela,"I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good."
5491,Michael,"Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak."
5492,Michael,"Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style."
5493,Michael,I don't think... I love it!
5494,Andy,"I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.  C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day."
5495,Michael, I don't know what he's doing.
5496,Dwight,Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
5497,Andy,Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
5498,Dwight,"Oh my gosh, now she's up."
5499,Jim,"And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it."
5500,Dwight,"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood.  Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers."
5501,Jim,"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing."
5502,Ryan,Looks like they forgot the power cord.
5503,Darryl,"Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. "
5504,Darryl,"Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your...  meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party."
5505,Darryl,All right. Se you later...
5506,Angela,Try harder then.  Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
5507,Kevin,You've got to be kidding!
5508,Angela,You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
5509,Andy," They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!"
5510,Michael,You know what we should do?
5511,Michael,We should invite them to the Christmas party.
5512,Andy,"Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy."
5513,Michael,"Oh, you are such mench my friend. "
5514,Michael,"OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. "
5515,Jim,"I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too."
5516,Michael,The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
5517,Michael,"Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours."
5518,Michael,Oh.  That's what she said.
5519,Michael,Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
5520,Michael," The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame."
5521,Michael,"Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room."
5522,Angela,"Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? "
5523,Angela,You can't have it  I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
5524,Michael,Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
5525,Dwight,Hey! It's Angela!  Hey!
5526,Michael,We're going to ...
5527,Kevin, I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
5528,Michael,"I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree?"
5529,Michael,Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.
5530,Michael,What're you talking about?
5531,Kevin," And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know."
5532,Angela,Did you have fun at Benihana's?
5533,Dwight,No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. 
5534,Angela,I've had the worse day here 
5535,Pam,Can I talk to you a second?
5536,Pam, In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
5537,Angela,I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
5538,Pam,"Yeah, but we don't have a power cord."
5539,Angela,"Oh, I may have seen it somewhere.  Is it this one?"
5540,Pam,We'll go tell everyone.
5541,Andy,I'll use my hands on it.
5542,Michael,"When you know, you just know."
5543,Michael,Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
5544,Michael,It's... it's one of those two. 
5545,Kevin,"Dude, you should know."
5546,Michael,"Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike."
5547,Michael,I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
5548,Michael,"Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her."
5549,Michael,"Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile "
5550,Michael,"Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party."
5551,Dwight," Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?"
5552,Angela," Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?"
5553,Jim,"What a horrible, horrible movie that was."
5554,Michael,"Hey, hey, you. How are ya?"
5555,Michael,"No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and..."
5556,Michael,Where do you wanna go?
5557,Michael,"I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica."
5558,Michael,You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
5559,Dwight," Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed..."
5560,Michael,That waitress was the one.
5561,Michael,How can you be sure?
5562,Jim,"Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago."
5563,Michael,Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
5564,Michael,"I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm."
5565,Michael,"I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!"
5566,Michael,"Oh, why do I feel like crap?"
5567,Jim,You just had a rebound.
5568,Michael,I had rebound? Yeah.
5569,Jim,"Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart."
5570,Michael,"I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o."
5571,Angela," Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.."
5572,Michael," Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive..."
5573,Angela," ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum "
5574,Angela," I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum."
5575,Dwight, pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
5576,Jim," Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents."
5577,Pam,We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier.
5578,Jim,"Oh no, that would be great."
5579,Pam,It costs seventy five dollars.
5580,Jim,"Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?"
5581,Dwight," What the?  ""You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone."" Destroy phone? "
5582,Jim,"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also...  what is this?"
5583,Dwight,For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
5584,Jim,"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?"
5585,Jim,"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?"
5586,Jim,You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
5587,Jim,"Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!"
5588,Dwight,I do not have a knife!
5589,Jim,"No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!"
5590,Dwight, Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
5591,Jim, Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
5592,Dwight,Give me it. I am not.
5593,Dwight,"Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK."
5594,Jim,"Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies."
5595,Dwight,You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
5596,Andy,I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
5597,Pam,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...  that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
5598,Michael,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax."
5599,Michael,"Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later."
5600,Pam,It's kind of serious.
5601,Michael,Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
5602,Michael,"Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too."
5603,Michael,"OK, well payroll is in charge of all that."
5604,Michael,"Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna..."
5605,Michael,You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
5606,Jim,You want to talk about it?
5607,Michael,"Feelin' hot, hot, hot!  Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing."
5608,Michael,"You know, I had never been out of the country before now?"
5609,Michael,"Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time."
5610,Pam,It's kind of an impoverished country.
5611,Michael,"Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three."
5612,Pam,"But you can't today, we're doing inventory."
5613,Michael,Inventory's at the end of December.
5614,Pam,"We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed."
5615,Michael,I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
5616,Michael,"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?"
5617,Michael,"Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it."
5618,Angela,By the end of the day? That's impossible.
5619,Michael,"The Jamaicans don't have a word for ""impossible."""
5620,Jim,"Yep, it's English, it's ""impossible."""
5621,Angela,"Michael, there's no way we can do it in time."
5622,Michael,"How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need."
5623,Michael,"Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  ""No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem."" This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem."
5624,Pam,Oh my God. Is that Jan? 
5625,Michael,"No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue."
5626,Michael,"Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. s*x. We had s*x. I had s*x with her. I had s*x with Jan."
5627,Michael, Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
5628,Michael,"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay."
5629,Michael,"Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim."
5630,Michael,"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?"
5631,Michael,Check it again. Hit refresh.
5632,Michael,Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
5633,Michael,"OK, Hey, man, how's it going?"
5634,Darryl,"All right, what's up Mike?"
5635,Michael,"That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?"
5636,Michael,"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not ""packaging."" Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?"
5637,Michael,"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it."
5638,Michael,And you sent that out to everyone?
5639,Darryl,"Mike, I'm very busy down here. "
5640,Kevin,Already sent it to you my friend.
5641,Andy,Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
5642,Jim,"Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen."
5643,Pam,Oh. You want to talk about it?
5644,Michael,I have a special assignment for you.
5645,Michael,"A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is ""Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."""
5646,Dwight,"Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment."
5647,Dwight,"OK, I accept it."
5648,Jim,"So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much."
5649,Pam,"How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?"
5650,Pam,"Honestly, I think you should go easy on her."
5651,Pam,"No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah."
5652,Jim,"Hey, thanks a lot."
5653,Pam,"Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!"
5654,Jim,"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? "
5655,Michael,"Not now, not ever."
5656,Michael,"Aww, none of your business."
5657,Michael,"That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops."
5658,Michael,This is probably the icebreaker you need.
5659,Michael,"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv."
5660,Michael,"No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?"
5661,Angela,"OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping."
5662,Angela,Did you try the petting zoo?
5663,Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you."
5664,Michael,"Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat."
5665,Pam,"He'll call you back. OK, great."
5666,Michael,She bought it?  OK. OK.
5667,Dwight, Michael hit a deer?
5668,Dwight,Michael! Michael!  There's an emergency in the warehouse.
5669,Michael,There an accident? Somebody hurt?
5670,Dwight,"No, it's... involves the photograph."
5671,Michael,"Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no."
5672,Michael,"Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---"
5673,Michael,"No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe..."
5674,Michael,"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?"
5675,Michael,"Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! "
5676,Pam,What are you doing out here?
5677,Michael,Island living. You know?
5678,Pam,Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
5679,Michael,Did she say what it's about?
5680,Pam,That's all she said.
5681,Andy,Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot 
5682,Jim,"Uh, I think you dropped this "
5683,Dwight,I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
5684,Michael,There are copies in the bathroom?
5685,Dwight,There were. A lot of them.
5686,Pam,"Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous."
5687,Darryl,"Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up  You see that? This is the greatest night of my life."
5688,Dwight,Who did this to you?  Where is he?
5689,Pam,"What? No, it's not... it's nothing."
5690,Dwight, It's hot in here.
5691,Pam, Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
5692,Dwight,"I know.  So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?"
5693,Kevin,"Hi Jan, you look... tan."
5694,Kevin,Yeah. How was it?
5695,Michael,Who is Dr. Perry? I...
5696,Michael,"And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well."
5697,Michael,"So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh..."
5698,Michael,"Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - "
5699,Michael,"Jan, you... complete... me."
5700,Kevin,What am I going to do?  I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. 
5701,Michael,"Jim, could you come in here please?"
5702,Michael,"Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him."
5703,Michael,You know what? Get Pam.
5704,Jim,"Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend."
5705,Michael,"Oh, that is gross."
5706,Pam,Who is 'Long Tim'?
5707,Jim,"Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?"
5708,Pam,I would love to meet Long Tim.
5709,Kevin,That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
5710,Angela,They arrived this morning.
5711,Kevin,Are you sure? It is a big deal.
5712,Angela,Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
5713,Kevin,... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
5714,Andy,"Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river."
5715,Dwight,Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
5716,Angela,Thank you.  I... I don't want those.
5717,Michael,"Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you."
5718,Andy,"Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
5719,Michael,"Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first."
5720,Andy,"Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott."
5721,Andy,Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
5722,Michael,"Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you."
5723,Andy,"Well, it is very gracious of you to accept."
5724,Michael,"Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior."
5725,Michael,"Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley."
5726,Michael,You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
5727,Ryan,"I am very flattered. I was his second choice after ""Pass."""
5728,Michael,So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
5729,Dwight,"Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?"
5730,Jim,"Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot."
5731,Andy,Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
5732,Dwight,Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
5733,Andy,He does your laundry?
5734,Michael,"Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the ""Amazing Race.""  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?"
5735,Michael,"No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back."
5736,Ryan,Is there a prize?
5737,Michael,"It's just... brrrrrr... It's ""Amazing Race,"" Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it."
5738,Michael,"Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!"
5739,Jim,Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
5740,Dwight,"Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first."
5741,Andy,"In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."
5742,Andy,What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
5743,Michael,"Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment."
5744,Andy,"Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder."
5745,Angela,Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
5746,Angela,"Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun."
5747,Ryan,"Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?"
5748,Ryan,"Yeah, if you don't mind."
5749,Jim,You still do that thing?
5750,Andy,"I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?"
5751,Andy,My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
5752,Michael, Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
5753,Dwight,"No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear."
5754,Jim,"Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front."
5755,Dwight,"Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... "
5756,Pam,"Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time."
5757,Angela,This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
5758,Angela,"Yes, it is.  Hello?"
5759,Michael,"Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?"
5760,Michael,"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big."
5761,Andy,Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
5762,Michael,"You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency."
5763,Andy,"Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York."
5764,Michael,"I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company."
5765,Andy,"Oh, man, that is, like, poetry."
5766,Andy,"I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree."
5767,Michael,Stop it.  Stop it.
5768,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  This is Pam. I did?"
5769,Andy,"Oh man. Talk about your classic ""Lame dash O."" Do we even want that guy buying our paper?"
5770,Andy,I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
5771,Michael,"Ah, no. Don't worry about it."
5772,Andy,I really 'Schruted' it.
5773,Andy,"'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?"
5774,Michael,I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
5775,Ryan,Um...  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
5776,Jim,We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
5777,Dwight,Can I use your phone?
5778,Jim,"Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked."
5779,Jim,We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
5780,Jim,"And, also, any forms that you are going to need..."
5781,Jim,We can custom make them.
5782,Pam,Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
5783,Pam,"Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today."
5784,Kevin,How much did you win?
5785,Kevin,I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
5786,Jim,"Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?"
5787,Dwight,"Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time."
5788,Jim, And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
5789,Jim,"Hey, Kelly, it's Jim."
5790,Dwight,"Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays."
5791,Pam,"Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest."
5792,Angela,That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
5793,Angela,I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
5794,Pam,Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
5795,Angela,Well then. Have a nice day.
5796,Andy,Hey boss. Got a minute?
5797,Andy,"I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?"
5798,Andy,"That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?"
5799,Michael,"No, you are remembering it wrong."
5800,Michael,"Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three."
5801,Dwight,I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
5802,Jim,"Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence."
5803,Dwight,My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
5804,Jim,We should go on a double date.
5805,Jim,Sure. Look at you!
5806,Pam,"No, thanks. I had some already."
5807,Pam,"Oh, but, hey, Jim."
5808,Pam,I won an art contest today.
5809,Jim,No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. 
5810,Jim,Which one was it?
5811,Pam,I sent in one of my watercolors.
5812,Pam,It was the new one I did.
5813,Jim,Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
5814,Dwight,"Hey, we nailed the sale!"
5815,Michael,Where were you this morning?
5816,Dwight,I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
5817,Michael,"Why do you lie, liar?"
5818,Dwight,I am not a liar.
5819,Michael,You are lying right now.
5820,Andy,It sure seems like he is lying.
5821,Dwight,"Stay out of this, you!"
5822,Michael,"I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing."
5823,Dwight,"Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company."
5824,Michael,"Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard."
5825,Dwight,That's what she said.
5826,Michael,Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
5827,Dwight,It's going to be ok.
5828,Angela,"How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business."
5829,Dwight,That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
5830,Angela,I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
5831,Dwight,"Well, I don't have a lot of choices."
5832,Jim,"Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?"
5833,Jim,"Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?"
5834,Dwight,"Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... ."
5835,Andy,"Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp."
5836,Dwight,I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
5837,Ryan,"Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed."
5838,Angela,"Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had."
5839,Dwight,"One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered."
5840,Andy,"Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty...  Hello? Pretty good."
5841,Dwight,I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
5842,Dwight,"For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia."
5843,Dwight,I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
5844,Dwight,"How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable."
5845,Dwight,There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
5846,Dwight," I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over."
5847,Jim,Is that you singing?
5848,Andy,All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
5849,Jim,You gonna answer it?
5850,Andy,I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
5851,Andy,Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
5852,Andy,"I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna.  Andy and the tuna..."
5853,Jim,"I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win."
5854,Michael,"Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover."
5855,Andy,The cost of doing business.
5856,Michael,"Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman..."
5857,Andy,Was the top salesman...
5858,Michael,What does that even mean? That is impossible.
5859,Andy,Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
5860,Michael,"But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits."
5861,Kevin,"Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?"
5862,Oscar,"Oh, that's very funny."
5863,Kevin,"Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left."
5864,Andy,Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
5865,Andy,"Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my ""Lost"" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?"
5866,Michael,I don't know. Maybe.
5867,Andy,"Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going?"
5868,Andy,"Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you."
5869,Andy," Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss."
5870,Angela,Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
5871,Oscar,The one of all women?
5872,Angela,No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired.  And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
5873,Oscar,"OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you."
5874,Kevin,Can I join too?
5875,Dwight, Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
5876,Michael,Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
5877,Pam,Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
5878,Michael,Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
5879,Pam,"Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight."
5880,Michael,Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
5881,Michael,What did I say?
5882,Andy,"Which is like, ""Right on."" And Pam was like ""blah blah blah"" and you were like ""Yeah, psht."" Nailed it."
5883,Oscar,I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
5884,Michael,"No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific."
5885,Michael,"No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga."
5886,Oscar,Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
5887,Michael,"Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one."
5888,Dwight,Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
5889,Andy,"I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here.  Whizzzzz.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!"
5890,Jim,So Andy is in rare form today.
5891,Jim,"Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something."
5892,Michael,Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
5893,Andy,185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! 
5894,Jim,You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
5895,Ryan,"Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago."
5896,Jim,I liked you better when you were the temp.
5897,Michael,Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
5898,Michael,"Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?"
5899,Michael,"Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close."
5900,Dwight,I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
5901,Dwight, Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
5902,Dwight,Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
5903,Andy," In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed."
5904,Jim,Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
5905,Pam,"Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please."
5906,Jim,"Okay, good. Stay right here."
5907,Andy," Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one."
5908,Jim, Are there any messages?
5909,Michael,Nice to have Oscar back.
5910,Andy,Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
5911,Andy,Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
5912,Jim,What are you talking about?
5913,Andy,Where is my FREAKING phone?!
5914,Jim,You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.
5915,Andy,Maybe you're in the ceiling!
5916,Andy," I don't trust you, Phyllis!"
5917,Angela,"I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me."
5918,Michael,Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
5919,Michael,Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
5920,Angela,None of them. Especially not Andy.
5921,Michael,"Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly."
5922,Andy,Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
5923,Andy,"Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own."
5924,Michael,No. I don't want to do any of that.
5925,Andy,Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
5926,Michael,"No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy."
5927,Andy,"Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?"
5928,Dwight," Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you."
5929,Michael,Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
5930,Dwight,"Oh my God, she told you?"
5931,Michael,"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize."
5932,Michael,How's this place treating you?
5933,Dwight, The boss isn't funny.
5934,Dwight,I don't get to wear my ties.
5935,Michael,"So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please."
5936,Dwight,I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
5937,Michael,We can talk about that.  All right.
5938,Jim," Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall."
5939,Pam,I think we broke his brain. 
5940,Jim," ""It's not freakin' funny!"""
5941,Angela,Are you enjoying your fiesta?
5942,Oscar,"Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out --  it's great."
5943,Michael,Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
5944,Michael,"Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?"
5945,Dwight,You did this for me? 
5946,Michael,Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
5947,Pam,"No, I will not."
5948,Michael,So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
5949,Oscar,It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
5950,Michael,"Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much."
5951,Michael,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? "
5952,Dwight,"Oh, man.  No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! "
5953,Michael,It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
5954,Andy,"So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so."
5955,Andy,"Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!"
5956,Andy,It's so good to meet you!
5957,Michael,"Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road---"
5958,Dwight,How do you know it's going to be a boy?
5959,Michael,"How, would you stop interrupting please?"
5960,Michael,"Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life."
5961,Michael,Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
5962,Michael,"To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever."
5963,Michael,"Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra."
5964,Michael,We will demonstrate on Pam.
5965,Michael, You just twist your hand until something breaks.
5966,Michael,Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.
5967,Michael,"And remember no matter what, I will always love you."
5968,Dwight,What if he's a murderer?
5969,Michael,He's not going to be a murderer.
5970,Dwight,Maybe that's how you die.
5971,Michael,"You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?"
5972,Dwight,I want to do this.
5973,Michael,Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-
5974,Michael,"Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta."
5975,Jim,"Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So..."
5976,Michael,I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
5977,Michael,"I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat."
5978,Angela,Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.
5979,Michael,"No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys."
5980,Jim,"Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights."
5981,Pam,"Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck."
5982,Michael,Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh! 
5983,Michael,"I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man."
5984,Michael,You should get out of them.
5985,Michael,"It's the only time he can do it. 2:30 to 3:15. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious."
5986,Michael,I did not order a stripper.
5987,Michael,"Um, not personally, no."
5988,Michael,I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.
5989,Michael,So that's what that means.
5990,Michael,"Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! "
5991,Michael,Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.
5992,Angela,Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
5993,Pam,Well you seem a little tired.
5994,Jim,"Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking."
5995,Pam,You should get more sleep.
5996,Jim,"Yeah, I know I should."
5997,Pam,Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
5998,Jim,"No, I'm sure you're right."
5999,Pam,"When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference."
6000,Pam,Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.
6001,Jim,Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there.
6002,Pam,Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk.  Oh my God.
6003,Michael,Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
6004,Michael,Well get on it. And make it happen.
6005,Dwight,"Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-"
6006,Dwight,Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
6007,Dwight,"I knew you would, Nancy."
6008,Dwight,"No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?"
6009,Dwight,Nice. Do you have any blonde women?
6010,Ryan,He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling.
6011,Michael,"I'm in the, I'm in the s*x shop."
6012,Jim,"Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants."
6013,Michael,And you think that'd be sexy?
6014,Jim,"Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania."
6015,Michael,You wearing a thong?
6016,Angela,Sparkling cider is very good.
6017,Pam,I think that's champagne.
6018,Michael,"Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin."
6019,Michael,"Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?"
6020,Michael,"He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever."
6021,Michael,"Yes, but, Ben Franklin was."
6022,Michael,And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.
6023,Michael,"Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one. "
6024,Jim,Have you ever seen a stripper before?
6025,Dwight,Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.
6026,Dwight,"Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper."
6027,Dwight,"Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such."
6028,Dwight," Is she hot? Text back, ""Kind of."""
6029,Pam,But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?
6030,Michael,Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
6031,Ryan,Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
6032,Michael,But I got all the foot off of it.
6033,Pam,"Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?"
6034,Michael,"Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?"
6035,Dwight,I do! I want some man meat!
6036,Jim,"Michael, Dwight would like your man meat."
6037,Michael,"Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity."
6038,Pam,Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
6039,Pam,What do you mean?
6040,Pam,"Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together."
6041,Pam,I'm not into Jim. Yeah.
6042,Pam,Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.
6043,Kevin,"Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild."
6044,Michael,I call shuffle. Here we go. 
6045,Michael,"Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth."
6046,Michael,He's right there. There he is.
6047,Michael,"Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I?"
6048,Michael,Here we go. Alright!
6049,Michael,Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.
6050,Michael,You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...
6051,Michael,"Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!"
6052,Dwight,"Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it."
6053,Dwight,We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
6054,Pam,Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?
6055,Michael,On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
6056,Michael,"Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag."
6057,Michael,"Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?"
6058,Dwight,Care for a piece of chocolate?
6059,Dwight,Who is the king of Austria?
6060,Dwight,Who is the king of Prussia?
6061,Dwight,Who is the king of England?
6062,Dwight,"I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure."
6063,Michael,"Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will."
6064,Michael,I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
6065,Michael,"No, today at work."
6066,Michael,Yes. I kind of arranged it.
6067,Ryan,Kelly don't do this.
6068,Ryan,You know what you're doing.
6069,Jim,Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley?
6070,Pam,"Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever."
6071,Pam,Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.
6072,Michael,So you don't want to end our relationship?
6073,Michael,That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?
6074,Michael,You are. You are.
6075,Michael,"So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't."
6076,Dwight,Are you near sighted or far sighted?
6077,Jim,"Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again.  Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?"
6078,Dwight,What do you think?
6079,Jim,"In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment."
6080,Jim," Dwight, want an Altoid?"
6081,Jim,What are you doing?
6082,Dwight,I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. 
6083,Michael,"Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?"
6084,Michael,"Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride."
6085,Pam,"Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'."
6086,Jim,So what's in the box?
6087,Dwight,You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
6088,Angela,Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
6089,Dwight,"The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair."
6090,Jim,Those flowers are nice.
6091,Pam,"Also, Pam and Roy."
6092,Michael,There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
6093,Michael,How you doin'? You excited.
6094,Michael,"Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?"
6095,Michael,"You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous..."
6096,Michael,Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
6097,Michael,Just cover up that bald patch.
6098,Michael,You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
6099,Michael,Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
6100,Dwight,Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
6101,Jim,You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
6102,Jim,Did you ever see that movie?
6103,Dwight,Of course I saw it.
6104,Dwight,"I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it."
6105,Jim,"You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out."
6106,Dwight,"Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift."
6107,Kevin, Hi. I'm Kevin.  Where did you find her?
6108,Michael,"This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it."
6109,Michael,Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
6110,Michael,"I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over."
6111,Michael,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!"
6112,Michael,"Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!"
6113,Angela,"Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning."
6114,Michael,"Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you."
6115,Michael,"Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too."
6116,Dwight,"Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers."
6117,Pam,What do you mean?
6118,Pam,Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine
6119,Pam,"Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks"
6120,Dwight,"'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?"
6121,Dwight,The bride and groom? What are their names?
6122,Dwight,"Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on."
6123,Dwight,"Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend."
6124,Michael,Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
6125,Michael,I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
6126,Michael,I will take care of that.
6127,Michael,I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
6128,Kevin,No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
6129,Kevin,"Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation.  Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light."
6130,Pam,"You're kidding me, right?"
6131,Pam,"Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding."
6132,Michael,"Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines ""wedding"" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride ""Mawige..."
6133,Michael,"The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones."
6134,Michael,"Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance..."
6135,Michael,is a guy that...
6136,Michael,"he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay."
6137,Michael,No. I'm not going to...
6138,Michael,Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
6139,Jim,When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
6140,Pam,Oh... I'm pacing myself.
6141,Jim,Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
6142,Pam,No. I'm such a dorky dancer.
6143,Jim,I know. It's very cute.
6144,Jim,"Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical."
6145,Dwight,"I can't let you in, Michael."
6146,Dwight,"No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders."
6147,Michael,"Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song."
6148,Dwight,"You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure."
6149,Pam,"Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police."
6150,Michael, ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
6151,Jim,Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
6152,Michael,I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
6153,Michael,We are great together. We are a great team.
6154,Michael,Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
6155,Michael,"Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head."
6156,Michael,Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
6157,Michael,Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
6158,Michael,They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
6159,Michael,Be careful. Oh no!!  Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! 
6160,Michael,"Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?"
6161,Kevin,"My tire blew out on the way here, Michael."
6162,Kevin,I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
6163,Michael,Why is today a special day?
6164,Michael,"Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you..."
6165,Ryan,You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
6166,Michael,"In business school, Kevin. Business school."
6167,Michael,"A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us."
6168,Michael,Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
6169,Dwight,"""Don't be an idiot."" Changed my life."
6170,Dwight,"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, ""Would an idiot do that?"" And if they would, I do not do that thing."
6171,Michael,"Will they throw their hats, you think?"
6172,Michael,"A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air."
6173,Ryan,Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
6174,Michael,"Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: ""May your hats fly as high as your dreams."" ... That was a pretty good line."
6175,Michael,"I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!"
6176,Pam,"Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio."
6177,Pam,I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
6178,Jim,"Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on."
6179,Pam,"Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know."
6180,Pam,"Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way."
6181,Pam,"I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there."
6182,Michael,Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!
6183,Dwight,...Oh my God. Animal stool. 
6184,Pam,"Dwight, what are you doing?"
6185,Dwight,"Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you.  Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!"
6186,Dwight,BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
6187,Angela, ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
6188,Michael,"Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now."
6189,Ryan,"...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off..."
6190,Michael,"I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it."
6191,Dwight,We have... a bat... in the office.
6192,Angela,Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
6193,Jim,Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six.
6194,Dwight,"At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership."
6195,Jim,I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
6196,Dwight,What? What's so wierd?
6197,Jim,"The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well."
6198,Ryan,"And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott."
6199,Michael,"Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel."
6200,Dwight," This is your job, Halpert."
6201,Jim,That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
6202,Jim,What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
6203,Dwight,No... no. One crisis at a time.
6204,Dwight,"If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a ""sylvania."" Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ."
6205,Michael,"So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied?"
6206,Pam,"Oh! No, you should go."
6207,Michael,"Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies."
6208,Ryan,What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
6209,Michael,"Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up."
6210,Michael,"We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. "
6211,Jim,"Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare."
6212,Jim,The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
6213,Dwight,"I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog."
6214,Dwight,Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
6215,Dwight,Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
6216,Michael,"...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back."
6217,Michael,"...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid."
6218,Michael,"Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?"
6219,Michael,"Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?"
6220,Michael,"...Wait, Ryan said that?"
6221,Dwight,Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
6222,Kevin, I... am a hero!
6223,Michael,"Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay."
6224,Michael,David will always beat Goliath.
6225,Michael,"Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?"
6226,Michael,"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!"
6227,Michael,"Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things."
6228,Michael,"You heard me, pack your things."
6229,Jim,So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
6230,Dwight,Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
6231,Jim,"Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight."
6232,Dwight,Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
6233,Dwight,"Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen."
6234,Pam,...And it's all from the same series.
6235,Pam,"Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se."
6236,Pam,"I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever.  Hey, babe, how are you?"
6237,Dwight,... ... You're welcome.
6238,Pam,"Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home."
6239,Pam,"Maybe, I'm a little tired."
6240,Ryan,"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me."
6241,Michael,"Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex."
6242,Ryan,To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
6243,Michael,"A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business."
6244,Oscar,You're the one who said we needed more culture.
6245,Oscar,It's her first try.
6246,Oscar,"Well, those aren't Pam's strong points."
6247,Michael,"Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town."
6248,Michael,Wow! You did these... freehand?
6249,Michael,"My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?"
6250,Pam,What do you mean?
6251,Michael,I don't see a... price.
6252,Pam,Um... you wanna buy it?
6253,Michael,"Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?"
6254,Michael,That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
6255,Pam,Do you have something in your pocket?
6256,Michael,...Chunky. Do you want half?
6257,Michael,"It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera."
6258,Ryan,"It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited."
6259,Michael,Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
6260,Dwight,Yes. But this  seems to be...
6261,Michael,"And now, the chains."
6262,Michael,"A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school."
6263,Michael,"MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I don't see how he can."
6264,Dwight,I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
6265,Michael,"No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!"
6266,Jim,"Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?"
6267,Michael,"I will get out. Oh yes, I will."
6268,Pam,"So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?"
6269,Michael,"No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. "
6270,Kevin,"Is everything ok, Michael?"
6271,Michael,"I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key..."
6272,Michael,Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
6273,Jim,"Another worm? Like, are they friends?"
6274,Dwight,It's early bird gets the worm.
6275,Michael,"Pam, would you smell my breath?"
6276,Dwight,"Let me smell.  Good, not great."
6277,Michael,"""Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?"" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special."
6278,Michael,"Jimbo, last chance to carpool."
6279,Jim,"Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car."
6280,Michael,Sure? Might be a good idea.
6281,Michael,"Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip."
6282,Jim,Oh. Um. I think we're good.
6283,Jim,"Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?"
6284,Dwight,Thanks for inviting me along.
6285,Michael,"Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you."
6286,Michael,I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
6287,Michael,That's what she said.
6288,Michael,"Uh, yes you are."
6289,Michael,"Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I..."
6290,Michael,Ummm... I don't know.
6291,Dwight,"Talk to you later, Jan."
6292,Pam,"Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come."
6293,Pam,"Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things."
6294,Pam,"I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy."
6295,Michael,Beauty. Thank you sir!
6296,Dwight,You dressed exactly like the servants.
6297,Michael,"Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me."
6298,Dwight,Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
6299,Michael,"I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that."
6300,Dwight,That would have been really embarrassing.
6301,Pam,"Oh, that duck is so cute."
6302,Michael,"Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend."
6303,Michael,"Oh, um, potato salad."
6304,Dwight,It's from both of us.
6305,Michael,"Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here."
6306,Michael,"It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know."
6307,Pam,"Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?"
6308,Kevin,It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
6309,Pam,Hey. You made it.
6310,Pam,"Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis."
6311,Angela,"No thank you, Roy."
6312,Dwight,"Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces."
6313,Michael,What are you looking for? You bring dip?
6314,Michael,Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
6315,Michael,"You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all."
6316,Michael,I love this woman!
6317,Dwight,Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
6318,Dwight,No? Then you are an idiot.
6319,Michael,"Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So..."
6320,Michael,Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
6321,Pam," Oh.  No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite."
6322,Michael,"It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them."
6323,Michael,"Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?"
6324,Michael,I could go for an appeteaser.
6325,Michael,Bagel bites or something.
6326,Dwight,What's the square footage?
6327,Dwight,Does that include the garage?
6328,Michael,"Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate."
6329,Dwight,It's a common question.
6330,Michael,"David, how much did this house cost?"
6331,Dwight,"These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around."
6332,Dwight,"Cool, let's start with the banisters."
6333,Jim,"Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me."
6334,Michael,"Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. "
6335,Michael,Yeah. Do you have any ice?
6336,Michael,How about some Splenda?
6337,Kevin,"No, it is definitely under one of these hands. "
6338,Ryan,I think I heard it on Roy's side.
6339,Kevin,"No, it is here."
6340,Ryan, Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
6341,Kevin,Good thing you didn't listen to me.
6342,Dwight,"Huh.  Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? ."
6343,Dwight,Just the one window?
6344,Dwight,Are those real pearls?
6345,Jim,"Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care."
6346,Jim,"No, it was before I knew you so, its fine."
6347,Michael,This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
6348,Michael,You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
6349,Michael,"Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo."
6350,Michael,Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
6351,Michael,What are you doing?
6352,Michael,"Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy."
6353,Michael,What has gotten into you?
6354,Michael,"Come on, let's go back to the party."
6355,Michael,"Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan."
6356,Michael,"No, no, no, means please don't. Please."
6357,Michael,I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
6358,Michael,You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
6359,Pam,"Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you."
6360,Pam,"Hey, don't you have a daughter?"
6361,Dwight,"Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?"
6362,Dwight,I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
6363,Dwight,What do you know?
6364,Jim,"You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace."
6365,Jim,"Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here?  Wow. Ok. You got me."
6366,Jim,"So, none of them?"
6367,Michael,Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
6368,Jim,I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
6369,Dwight,"The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party."
6370,Pam,I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
6371,Pam,"Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us."
6372,Pam,Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
6373,Pam,"He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed."
6374,Michael,"Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle..."
6375,Michael,You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
6376,Michael,"Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly."
6377,Michael,I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
6378,Michael,"I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling."
6379,Michael,"That's all, you didn't mean it?"
6380,Michael,"I love you, Jan."
6381,Dwight,"Don't break up you guys, you're great together."
6382,Jim,I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds...
6383,Jim,"Kev, have a good weekend."
6384,Dwight,"Pam, please call security!"
6385,Dwight,"Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? "
6386,Michael,"No need for consternation, everything is under control."
6387,Michael,"It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled."
6388,Michael,"No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage."
6389,Jim,"I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars."
6390,Jim,"Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you."
6391,Dwight,"Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded."
6392,Jim,Okay. Um... Got you something.
6393,Jim,You don't know what it is.
6394,Dwight,Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
6395,Jim,"It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven."
6396,Dwight,"No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes."
6397,Oscar,"Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up."
6398,Kevin,"Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight."
6399,Angela,You saw it? Describe it please.
6400,Oscar,"Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero."
6401,Angela, Well... good for Dwight.
6402,Michael,"Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you."
6403,Jim,Where'd you get that?
6404,Michael,"Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information."
6405,Michael,"Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise."
6406,Jim,"Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise."
6407,Michael,"Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think...  that maybe you should... "
6408,Jim,I can't hear you.
6409,Michael,"What I'm saying is that, "
6410,Michael,"Ok, see what I did?"
6411,Michael,"By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position."
6412,Michael,"Ok, let's try another one. Um..."
6413,Michael,Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
6414,Jim,And what happens in this one?
6415,Michael,"Go ahead, ask me for a raise."
6416,Jim,Can I have a raise?
6417,Jim," s*x, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher."
6418,Michael,"No, what did you say?"
6419,Jim,I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.
6420,Michael,Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
6421,Dwight,"I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place."
6422,Dwight,"Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end."
6423,Ryan,I can't imagine what I would have done.
6424,Ryan,"Well that was funny, that's why."
6425,Ryan,You know what? I didn't---
6426,Ryan,"Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night..."
6427,Darryl,You ready for me?
6428,Michael,"Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat."
6429,Michael,"You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room."
6430,Michael,"No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room."
6431,Michael,Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.
6432,Michael,"Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control."
6433,Michael, I am declining to speak first.
6434,Darryl,"Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now."
6435,Michael,"Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now."
6436,Darryl,Are you wearin' lady clothes?
6437,Darryl,Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants.
6438,Michael,"No, this is a power suit."
6439,Darryl,That there's a woman's suit.
6440,Michael, I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.
6441,Darryl,"I'ma call Roy, man."
6442,Darryl,This is gonna make him feel better.
6443,Darryl,This is too good.
6444,Michael,"Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?"
6445,Pam,"Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!"
6446,Kevin,You're wearing a woman's suit?
6447,Michael,"No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin."
6448,Michael,"There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual."
6449,Michael,"Uh,  MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery."
6450,Michael,"Would you stop it, please?"
6451,Jim,"So, none of that tipped you off?"
6452,Michael,"It's European, OK? It's a European cut."
6453,Pam,"Michael, the pants don't have any pockets."
6454,Michael,"No, they don't. See? "
6455,Michael,Italians don't wear pockets.
6456,Pam,It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
6457,Michael,"No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway."
6458,Darryl,"Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton."
6459,Michael,"Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes."
6460,Darryl,"Okay, can you just stand right there?  I gotta send some e-mails."
6461,Michael,"Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes."
6462,Kevin,"Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?"
6463,Angela,"What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story."
6464,Michael,Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
6465,Darryl,"Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise."
6466,Darryl,What? I can't hear you.
6467,Michael, That was a very good point.
6468,Darryl,"I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---"
6469,Michael, You make a very compelling argument.
6470,Pam,Sorry I almost got you killed.
6471,Jim,"Yeah, that was nuts."
6472,Pam,"He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?"
6473,Jim,"No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection."
6474,Pam,"Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now."
6475,Jim,We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
6476,Pam,Jim... I am really... sorry.
6477,Jim,"Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it."
6478,Michael,"I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me."
6479,Darryl,Why can't I just... tell you?
6480,Michael,"Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes."
6481,Michael,Oh.  Come on. Be serious.
6482,Darryl,"I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want."
6483,Michael,"I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much."
6484,Darryl,"Come on, be for real Mike."
6485,Michael,I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.
6486,Darryl, Are you serious? You're earning this?
6487,Darryl,"Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog. "
6488,Darryl,"Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  Ah. "
6489,Michael,"Ok, let's take 15, again."
6490,Michael,"A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that."
6491,Jim,"Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something."
6492,Dwight,"When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?"
6493,Dwight,"No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?"
6494,Jim,"It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating."
6495,Jim,"Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?"
6496,Kevin,"Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you."
6497,Kevin,Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...
6498,Michael,I didn't give you $40.
6499,Darryl," Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know.  Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later. "
6500,Michael,"Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia."
6501,Michael,"I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise."
6502,Darryl,"That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss."
6503,Michael,Well what am I supposed to do?
6504,Darryl,"Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son."
6505,Michael,I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.
6506,Darryl,"Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship."
6507,Michael,You know what? I should.
6508,Michael,I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
6509,Michael,You know what? I deserve a bump.
6510,Darryl,"Make it happen, cap'in."
6511,Michael,"I am makin' it happen, sergeant."
6512,Michael,"No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today."
6513,Michael,"Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away."
6514,Michael,"Yes, I'm bringing Darryl."
6515,Michael,"Hey, I'd rather kill myself."
6516,Michael," No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known."
6517,Ryan,I don't know what you're talking about.
6518,Ryan,"No, I said your idea was stupid."
6519,Michael,"Toby, come on. Let's go."
6520,Michael,"Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go."
6521,Ryan,Don't you see why that's insane?
6522,Darryl,"How about you, man. Comfortable?"
6523,Darryl,I haven't been to New York in a long time.
6524,Michael,"Mm, the Big Apple."
6525,Darryl,Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there.
6526,Darryl,Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.
6527,Darryl,"Mm, it's not that big."
6528,Darryl,"Busses, though. They get you home quick."
6529,Angela,Then what'd he do? 
6530,Darryl,"Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you."
6531,Michael,"Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity."
6532,Darryl,Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me
6533,Darryl,"Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself."
6534,Kevin, Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
6535,Jim,"Thanks, Kev. I'm good though."
6536,Michael,Who's the boy toy?
6537,Michael,Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
6538,Michael,"Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers."
6539,Michael,Six percent? After all we've been through?
6540,Michael,I got you... jade earrings.
6541,Michael,"No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x.   What are you writing, perv-ball?"
6542,Pam,"I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices."
6543,Pam,"Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend."
6544,Pam,"No, there were a lot of reasons."
6545,Dwight,"Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. ""Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute"""
6546,Jim,Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor.
6547,Dwight,Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
6548,Jim, Didn't think you'd notice...
6549,Michael,"Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!"
6550,Michael,"Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere."
6551,Michael,"Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---"
6552,Michael,Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
6553,Michael,"Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise."
6554,Michael,But you just said 15.
6555,Michael,"Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--"
6556,Angela,Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading.
6557,Angela,Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.
6558,Angela,"Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together."
6559,Jim," I... will never say a word. And now, we are even."
6560,Andy,"I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  So look out Dunder Mifflin!   I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you..."
6561,Andy,"Hey guys! Guess who's back!  AHHH!  OH, GOD!"
6562,Dwight,No need to thank me.
6563,Pam,"Oh, welcome back, Andy."
6564,Andy,Drew. I'm Drew now.
6565,Andy,Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. 
6566,Andy,"Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident.  But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies."
6567,Jim,"Hey, Andy. How are you, man?"
6568,Andy,Dr--- You can call me Drew.
6569,Jim,"No, I'm not gonna call you that."
6570,Andy,Drew.  Dwight. How's it goin' man?
6571,Dwight,"Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna."
6572,Dwight,"Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned."
6573,Jim,"Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug."
6574,Dwight,"Ok, tell him that's not true."
6575,Jim,Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
6576,Dwight,"Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!"
6577,Jim," Andy! Nah, that's too far."
6578,Michael,"Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity."
6579,Darryl,Should you drive the forklift?
6580,Michael,"I can, and I have."
6581,Darryl,"It's not safe, you don't have a license."
6582,Michael,"Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  Pudge has driven the forklift."
6583,Michael,I thought your name was Pudge?
6584,Darryl,"Her. Yes, ""her"" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?"
6585,Darryl,Do you understand that?
6586,Darryl,"We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled..."
6587,Michael," ""Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"" "
6588,Darryl,And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
6589,Darryl,The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
6590,Darryl,How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
6591,Michael,Bail'er? I hardly know her.
6592,Darryl,Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody?
6593,Kevin,Five bucks says it's over 50.
6594,Jim,You really wanna bet?
6595,Kevin,"Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored."
6596,Darryl,"Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?"
6597,Darryl," You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful..."
6598,Jim,"No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'."
6599,Jim,"I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out."
6600,Oscar,What are you guys talkin' about?
6601,Michael,"Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody..."
6602,Michael,It's a big red trash compactor!
6603,Darryl,It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!
6604,Michael,"Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions..."
6605,Darryl,No do not touch it!
6606,Michael,...would I go near---
6607,Darryl,"There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?"
6608,Michael,"Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!"
6609,Michael,"Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and..."
6610,Michael,"Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?"
6611,Darryl,Take them at the same time.
6612,Michael,"Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?"
6613,Ryan,What about a long sleeve T?
6614,Kevin,Long johns? A shaw?
6615,Michael,"Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  Sorry, he is very lame.  Um, let's see. ""Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."""
6616,Darryl,Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
6617,Michael,"Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation."
6618,Michael,"Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. ""A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"""
6619,Michael,"Yes. ""Which can contribute to heart disease."" Heart disease kills more people that balers."
6620,Michael,"Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary..."
6621,Ryan,"Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize."
6622,Darryl,"Alright, we outta here."
6623,Michael,"Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---"
6624,Darryl,"That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it."
6625,Michael,"Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?"
6626,Michael,"Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... ""Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today."" ... This is one example."
6627,Oscar,"Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant."
6628,Jim,There's like ten green ones.
6629,Jim,I'm gonna say fifty.
6630,Jim,"Oh, don't be that person."
6631,Pam,It's called being smart.
6632,Pam,"I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun."
6633,Pam,"47, 48, 49! Jim wins!"
6634,Michael,"Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?"
6635,Pam,I don't understand the question.
6636,Michael,Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.
6637,Michael,"I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that..."
6638,Pam,It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.
6639,Michael,"Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science."
6640,Michael,"They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes."
6641,Dwight,"Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?"
6642,Michael,"I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---"
6643,Dwight,A quilt. Depression quilt?
6644,Michael,"You may be asking yourself, ""What am I doing on a trampoline?"" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, ""Hey! You ever seen a suicide?"" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note: They might think ""Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael."" But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da! "
6645,Ryan,I guess I forgot. 
6646,Kevin,"Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said ""awesome"" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies."
6647,Dwight," Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!"
6648,Michael,"Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or..."
6649,Dwight,We measured it once...
6650,Michael,Go buy some watermelons.
6651,Michael,Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
6652,Michael,BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.
6653,Michael,"Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes."
6654,Michael,"Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler."
6655,Dwight,We're not allowed to use the baler.
6656,Michael,"Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster."
6657,Dwight,I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
6658,Dwight,It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.
6659,Dwight,"Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle."
6660,Andy,You mean a moon bounce.
6661,Dwight,What do you think? You've got an hour.
6662,Andy,I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
6663,Andy,"Do you, do you want a drawbridge?"
6664,Dwight,Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.
6665,Dwight,"Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision."
6666,Michael,"Yes, thank you for seeing that."
6667,Dwight,"When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults."
6668,Michael,I don't know if I wanna do this.
6669,Dwight,Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
6670,Michael,"No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking."
6671,Dwight,That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!
6672,Michael,That's right! I am not thinking.
6673,Dwight, Near near near near near!
6674,Dwight, Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!
6675,Dwight, Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!
6676,Dwight, Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
6677,Michael,I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point! 
6678,Dwight," Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!"
6679,Andy,Whoa! What's the situation?
6680,Dwight, Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
6681,Andy,"Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?"
6682,Dwight,Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
6683,Dwight,It's gorgeous. Let's go!
6684,Dwight,"No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!"
6685,Ryan,Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
6686,Dwight,"Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!"
6687,Dwight," Come on, hurry up you guys!"
6688,Michael," My life! Oh, my life..."
6689,Michael,"Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression."
6690,Dwight,Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
6691,Michael,"Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!"
6692,Dwight,Is that the last year the data was available?
6693,Michael,Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
6694,Dwight,Don't do anything rash!
6695,Michael,"Wait, where are the warehouse guys?"
6696,Dwight,I didn't...  I didn't think you needed them for this part.
6697,Dwight,you said to just...
6698,Michael,"That's the whole point, dummy."
6699,Dwight,"Okay, I'm on it!"
6700,Dwight,Attention blue collar workers!
6701,Pam,What are the odds that this is in any way real?
6702,Jim,"I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?"
6703,Kevin,"Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds."
6704,Dwight,Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
6705,Michael,"Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed."
6706,Dwight,Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
6707,Michael,"Dwight, you ignorant slut."
6708,Jim,"Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee."
6709,Michael,"And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!"
6710,Jim,"Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part."
6711,Angela,This is just offensive.
6712,Ryan,At least we're outside.
6713,Dwight,"No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael."
6714,Pam,"Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump."
6715,Jim,"Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself."
6716,Jim,"Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured."
6717,Pam,"Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it."
6718,Pam,Come down and... open it and you'll see.
6719,Michael,"Dwight, find out what the present is."
6720,Dwight,"Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing."
6721,Pam,"Dwight, what are you---"
6722,Dwight,"Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan."
6723,Michael,"Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?"
6724,Darryl,"Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself."
6725,Michael,"You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life."
6726,Darryl,"Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for."
6727,Michael,What do I have to live for?
6728,Darryl,"A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right?"
6729,Michael,"It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The s*x isn't nearly as good as it used to be."
6730,Michael,Do you really mean that?
6731,Darryl,I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave.
6732,Michael,I'm braver than you?
6733,Michael,I Braveheart. I am.
6734,Michael,"Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present."
6735,Michael,"An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes."
6736,Jim, It's kind of blurry.  That's better.  Question. What kind of bear is best?
6737,Dwight,That's a ridiculous question.
6738,Dwight,Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---
6739,Jim,Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
6740,Dwight,Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
6741,Jim,"Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of...  eleven dollars."
6742,Dwight,"You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you.  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!"
6743,Dwight,"Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!"
6744,Pam," Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?"
6745,Jim, Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.
6746,Michael," It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper."
6747,Michael,"We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan."
6748,Michael,"Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime."
6749,Ryan,"F and C, doubletime?"
6750,Michael,Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?
6751,Jim,One more. Why are you talking like that?
6752,Michael,"To save time, Jim."
6753,Pam,"Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time."
6754,Michael,You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?
6755,Michael,"Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy."
6756,Michael,"We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today."
6757,Oscar,That's really not our job.
6758,Angela, I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing.
6759,Michael,"Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids."
6760,Jim,"Yeah, I gotta call out on that."
6761,Michael,"No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person."
6762,Michael,I want you to bring a partner.
6763,Michael,"No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go."
6764,Andy," William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do."
6765,Jim,"Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone."
6766,Michael,"No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference."
6767,Dwight,"Yes! You are entering the ""No Spin Zone!"""
6768,Pam,We're having a press conference?
6769,Michael,"No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves."
6770,Michael,"Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J."
6771,Michael,"I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story."
6772,Jim,"Oh, did the press ask for a story?"
6773,Oscar,I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
6774,Angela,Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
6775,Kevin,"Oh! Can I be  Australian, mate?"
6776,Kevin," I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies."
6777,Andy,"Hand me that water. I always say ""Beer me."" Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?"
6778,Jim,You know her name.
6779,Andy,"Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?"
6780,Andy,"Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet."
6781,Jim,What about music? Do you have any music?
6782,Andy,"Uh, yeah. Should have said so.  Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--"
6783,Jim,"I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD."
6784,Andy,"Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc."
6785,Jim,"Lord, beer me strength."
6786,Andy,"So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?"
6787,Andy,Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
6788,Andy,Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
6789,Jim,"Oh, is she that teacher in the white?"
6790,Andy,"No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef."
6791,Jim,Which one... is she?
6792,Andy,The one in the green hoodie.
6793,Andy,"I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?"
6794,Jim,"No, I don't think so."
6795,Andy,"She's like, probably a tutor."
6796,Andy,She probably a t--
6797,Michael,"OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice."
6798,Dwight,"On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair."
6799,Dwight,"First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, ""Wow, I need this beet right now."" Those are the money beets."
6800,Dwight,"  Hey!  Look sharp!  Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute."
6801,Dwight,"And you must be uh, from the Washington Post."
6802,Dwight,"And ""Breaking Corporate News."""
6803,Dwight,"Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance."
6804,Dwight,"Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?"
6805,Andy,What are you doing here?
6806,Andy,Are you a student here?
6807,Andy,You never told me you were in high-school!
6808,Andy,I had no idea.
6809,Jim,Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
6810,Andy,Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
6811,Oscar," Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale."
6812,Angela," Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. "
6813,Pam,"Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye."
6814,Michael,"Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really."
6815,Michael,"And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first."
6816,Dwight, You look good in this.
6817,Michael,"So, let us consider this matter ended."
6818,Michael,"I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry."
6819,Michael,"Well, we are extremely sorry."
6820,Andy,Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.
6821,Jim,Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.
6822,Andy,"I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---"
6823,Andy,That's not what I had in mind.
6824,Angela, Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want?  He's upset about the watermark.
6825,Angela,"...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not.   I think he had Tourette's or something!"
6826,Michael,"We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again."
6827,Michael,The watermark... it's a one time thing.
6828,Dwight,May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.
6829,Dwight,"I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right."
6830,Michael,"What... can I do, for you?"
6831,Michael,"Well...  OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---"
6832,Michael,The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
6833,Michael,"No, I'm a regional manager---"
6834,Michael,"No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!"
6835,Michael,That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
6836,Michael,Doesn't matter. Out please!
6837,Michael,"Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?"
6838,Michael,"We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not..."
6839,Pam,It's just the Scranton Times...
6840,Michael,"No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it..."
6841,Pam,You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
6842,Michael,You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  Do you know what this is for?
6843,Pam,Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.
6844,Michael," OK, I think that's good."
6845,Michael,"""Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."""
6846,Dwight,"Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team."
6847,Michael,That's how devoted I am to this job.
6848,Dwight,They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.
6849,Michael,"I understand that, Dwight."
6850,Dwight,"You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb."
6851,Michael,"Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?"
6852,Michael,So I'll know where---
6853,Michael,"I'm asking Pam to do it, please."
6854,Angela,"Kevin, what's four plus seven?"
6855,Angela,"Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form."
6856,Kevin,"Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial."
6857,Angela,You two are apes.
6858,Oscar,"I expect you to apologize for that, Angela."
6859,Angela,I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
6860,Kevin,"Oh, but you still said ""I'm sorry."""
6861,Angela,I called you morons.
6862,Oscar,"Still said it, so... "
6863,Michael,"Five, four, three. ""There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day."""
6864,Pam,One day for what?
6865,Michael,That's... they always give an ultimatum.
6866,Pam,Cut. That was your best apology video ever.
6867,Jim,"Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right."
6868,Jim," A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
6869,Andy,You know what--- I don't---
6870,Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
6871,Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
6872,Jim,"A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh..."
6873,Pam,"Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today."
6874,Dwight, Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
6875,Dwight,"Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?"
6876,Dwight,"Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh."
6877,Dwight,That is a demerit.
6878,Jim," ""Jim Halpert, tardiness."" Ugh. I love it already."
6879,Dwight,"You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law."
6880,Jim,"Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?"
6881,Dwight, Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
6882,Jim,Lay it on me.
6883,Dwight,Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
6884,Jim,Now that sounds serious.
6885,Dwight,"Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior."
6886,Jim,Which would be me.
6887,Jim,"OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation."
6888,Dwight,What's a dis... what's that?
6889,Jim,"Oh, you don't want to know."
6890,Pam," Hey, Phyllis. You all right?"
6891,Andy,What happened? What can I do to help?
6892,Andy,I'll check the web.
6893,Jim, Thank you.  The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
6894,Pam, Can you tell us what happened?
6895,Angela,Phyllis. You're a married woman.
6896,Pam," It's just, like, so creepy."
6897,Pam,"Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot."
6898,Michael,Really? Is she OK?
6899,Pam,"Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down."
6900,Michael,"OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm. "
6901,Angela,What is so funny?
6902,Michael,"Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?"
6903,Michael, I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
6904,Jim,"Mm... not really, no."
6905,Pam,It's disgusting and demeaning.
6906,Michael,"Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  He's back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh! "
6907,Michael,"Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... "
6908,Michael,"Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul."
6909,Michael,"Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher."
6910,Michael,"Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your pen1s.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong."
6911,Michael,"In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me."
6912,Michael,I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
6913,Michael,"Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable."
6914,Michael,"I... uh, well, I don't know."
6915,Dwight,"Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free."
6916,Michael, I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
6917,Dwight,Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
6918,Dwight," There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert."
6919,Dwight,Look at that one.
6920,Michael,"Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. "
6921,Michael,"Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say."
6922,Dwight,"Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his pen1s - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force."
6923,Jim, Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
6924,Dwight,"Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking.  Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?"
6925,Dwight,"Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody."
6926,Pam,"I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.  Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things."
6927,Pam,That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
6928,Dwight,Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
6929,Dwight,Desperate times call for desperate measures.
6930,Pam," ""Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors."" Nobody dress like that. "
6931,Michael,"OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that."
6932,Michael,"See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?"
6933,Dwight,"Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?"
6934,Michael,"No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation."
6935,Jim,"Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?"
6936,Michael,"Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?"
6937,Dwight," Mm, less than three."
6938,Michael,That is not current.
6939,Dwight,You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
6940,Jim,Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
6941,Dwight,Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
6942,Michael,You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
6943,Michael,"I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter."
6944,Michael,"Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited."
6945,Michael,"OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie."
6946,Michael,"What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this."
6947,Andy,"If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models."
6948,Kevin,"Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me."
6949,Michael,"Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything."
6950,Michael,No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
6951,Michael,Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
6952,Angela,"And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods."
6953,Michael,I have to know whether you're serious or not.
6954,Dwight,I wish I could menstruate.
6955,Dwight,"If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides."
6956,Michael,"Ye - OK, yes."
6957,Angela,This is not work talk.
6958,Michael,"You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. "
6959,Angela,Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
6960,Michael,"OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Let's go!"
6961,Dwight,Have you finished with the sketch?
6962,Dwight,"Hmm, doesn't seem like the type."
6963,Pam,"Uh, Phyllis got a good look."
6964,Dwight," I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide."
6965,Angela,"Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead."
6966,Pam,"Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter."
6967,Kevin,"Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?"
6968,Jim,"No. Thank you, though."
6969,Jim,Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
6970,Kevin,"Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy."
6971,Kevin, Yeah. I'm going in.
6972,Andy,I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
6973,Dwight,"Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building."
6974,Andy,This guy looks like a real deviant.
6975,Dwight,"No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those."
6976,Dwight,"More like, ""Aye, aye, General."""
6977,Michael, I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - 
6978,Jim," Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool."
6979,Ryan,"Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up."
6980,Jim,"No, we've been dating for six months."
6981,Ryan,"Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -"
6982,Jim,"Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend."
6983,Ryan,I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
6984,Michael,All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
6985,Michael,"You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish."
6986,Pam,What do you want to dish about?
6987,Michael,"Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it ""shmear?"" Like the cream cheese."
6988,Pam,"OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?"
6989,Michael,"What, um... what do you think of role-play?"
6990,Michael,"Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy."
6991,Michael,I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
6992,Angela,OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
6993,Angela,"Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls."
6994,Pam,"Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with."
6995,Michael,Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.
6996,Michael, And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
6997,Michael,"No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it."
6998,Pam,"Michael, you need to get out of this."
6999,Michael,"No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing."
7000,Pam,"No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. "
7001,Michael,"No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? "
7002,Pam,Read the pros first.
7003,Michael,"OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt."
7004,Michael,Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
7005,Pam,What was the last one?
7006,Michael,She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
7007,Michael,I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
7008,Pam,Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
7009,Michael,I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having s*x.
7010,Pam,Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
7011,Michael,That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
7012,Michael,I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
7013,Michael,"Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories."
7014,Pam,No one said it has no calories.
7015,Michael,"Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here."
7016,Michael,"Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked."
7017,Kevin," This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often."
7018,Michael,"Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear."
7019,Pam,I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
7020,Angela, Slower. Slower. Meredith.  Slow it up.
7021,Michael,"Oh. Oh, no.  It's Jan. What do I do?"
7022,Jim, That is pretty cool.
7023,Michael,"Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will..."
7024,Pam,"Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on."
7025,Michael,"Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right. "
7026,Pam,I think I've got it.
7027,Michael,Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
7028,Pam,"I don't think we really need that, Michael."
7029,Michael,Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
7030,Pam,"You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy.  Coming!"
7031,Andy,Think we'll find him?
7032,Dwight,"Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests."
7033,Andy,"Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot."
7034,Andy,"Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera."
7035,Dwight,"You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. "
7036,Michael,"OK, I am really going to do this."
7037,Michael,"You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. "
7038,Michael,I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.
7039,Pam,Don't leave a -
7040,Michael," Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later."
7041,Michael,"Maybe some Italian.  ""... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -""  Chinese?  ""who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy."""
7042,Michael," Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. ""Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?"" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all."
7043,Dwight," Dunder-Mifflin paper/s*x predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute."
7044,Jim,"Hey, Dwight. It's Jim."
7045,Dwight,"Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy."
7046,Jim,"No, you're not. I'm looking right at you."
7047,Dwight,Ugh. I'm hanging up.
7048,Jim,Don't.  I have information about the s*x predator.
7049,Dwight,You have information about the s*x predator?
7050,Jim,I saw him two minutes ago.
7051,Jim,"In the women's bathroom, above the sink."
7052,Dwight, Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm.  PAM!
7053,Dwight,"OK, where does it hurt?"
7054,Michael,Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
7055,Dwight,"No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body."
7056,Dwight,"""The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."""
7057,Michael,Not it. I don't have eggs.
7058,Pam,"About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned."
7059,Dwight,"Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?"
7060,Pam,David Wallace is on line one.
7061,Michael,"OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK."
7062,Michael,"To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?"
7063,Michael,And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
7064,Michael,"Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes..."
7065,Michael,...you just gots to get your freak on.
7066,Michael,Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
7067,Michael,May God guide you in your quest.
7068,Michael,"OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus."
7069,Michael,"Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?"
7070,Oscar,"I don't wear a Speedo, Michael."
7071,Michael,"Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally."
7072,Michael,"Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going."
7073,Michael,"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here."
7074,Michael,I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
7075,Pam,"Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece."
7076,Michael,"Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you"
7077,Pam,I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
7078,Michael,"We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me."
7079,Michael,What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
7080,Pam,You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
7081,Michael,"I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?"
7082,Pam,"I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?"
7083,Michael,This way to the partay bus.
7084,Kevin,I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
7085,Kevin,"  And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.""  You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done."
7086,Michael,"Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach."
7087,Michael,"If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus."
7088,Michael,"Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!"
7089,Dwight,Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
7090,Michael,"Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off."
7091,Dwight,I hope there will be management parables.
7092,Michael,"Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?"
7093,Michael,Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
7094,Pam,"Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?"
7095,Michael,Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
7096,Michael,Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!
7097,Angela,Everyone put on sunscreen.
7098,Michael,"Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle 'round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor."
7099,Michael,"Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley."
7100,Michael,Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
7101,Michael,"Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something."
7102,Michael,"Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot."
7103,Michael,We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
7104,Dwight,We will be called Gryffindor.
7105,Dwight,"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim."
7106,Jim,"I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort."
7107,Dwight,He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
7108,Jim," Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!"
7109,Dwight,"OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that."
7110,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?"
7111,Michael,Then I will name your team the Red team.
7112,Michael,I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
7113,Andy,We will be team U.S.A.
7114,Michael,"Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic."
7115,Michael,Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
7116,Michael,It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
7117,Michael,"Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! "
7118,Oscar,"Come on Phyllis, you can do it.  Ahh..."
7119,Andy,"Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. "
7120,Andy,Don't worry. You're not...
7121,Andy,No where near the big rock.
7122,Andy,"What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified."
7123,Andy,I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! 
7124,Jim," Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole."
7125,Jim,"Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left."
7126,Dwight, Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
7127,Ryan,"Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore."
7128,Dwight,What are you saying?
7129,Ryan,You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
7130,Dwight,"OK, I apologize for yelling at you."
7131,Ryan,That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
7132,Dwight,I am trying to bring team spirit.
7133,Jim," Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes!"
7134,Pam,"There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. "
7135,Dwight, Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you b*st*rd!  What the? Damn it temp!
7136,Andy," Great job everyone, that was fantastic. "
7137,Michael,"Okay Pam, I have another little project for you."
7138,Pam,Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
7139,Michael,"Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it."
7140,Michael,Like umm... ten minutes?
7141,Pam,How am I supposed to... get...
7142,Michael,A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
7143,Michael,"OK, who's hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set."
7144,Michael,"No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?"
7145,Oscar,Turkey is a healthy meat.
7146,Dwight,It's very good for you. 
7147,Michael,"Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!"
7148,Michael,"No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily."
7149,Michael,"Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize."
7150,Jim,"You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?"
7151,Michael,"The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world."
7152,Michael,The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
7153,Michael,I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
7154,Andy, I am so hungry! 
7155,Michael, Word.  There we go. Let's see it.
7156,Michael,"Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!"
7157,Michael,"13 hot dogs, everybody!"
7158,Angela,What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
7159,Dwight,No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
7160,Angela,I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
7161,Dwight,"If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me."
7162,Michael,It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
7163,Michael,Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.
7164,Jim,What are you doing?
7165,Jim,"Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day."
7166,Oscar,If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
7167,Andy,I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
7168,Dwight,That's not why you lost.
7169,Andy,Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
7170,Andy,"Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! "
7171,Dwight, Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
7172,Andy," Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!"
7173,Angela,"What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them?"
7174,Andy,"Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!"
7175,Angela,I don't understand what you want from me.
7176,Andy,"Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!"
7177,Michael,"I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?"
7178,Pam,"I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units."
7179,Michael,Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
7180,Pam,"I really doubt it, Michael."
7181,Jim," Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye."
7182,Jim,How would that work in well? I just want to know.
7183,Jim,"If this job is in a well, I don't want it."
7184,Michael,What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
7185,Michael,"Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!"
7186,Michael,Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
7187,Kevin,Are you going to try it?
7188,Angela,I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
7189,Kevin,"Angela, it is a million degrees."
7190,Pam,"I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?"
7191,Michael,"No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score."
7192,Pam,I'd like to try it.
7193,Pam,But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it.
7194,Michael,"Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up."
7195,Michael,Ji.. why not? C'mon.
7196,Jim,"Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned."
7197,Michael,You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
7198,Michael,Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
7199,Andy," Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello?"
7200,Kevin,Why don't you go Michael?
7201,Michael,Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
7202,Jim,"And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself."
7203,Michael,Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.
7204,Pam,Do you want us to count to three?
7205,Michael,"Yes. Count to three, please."
7206,Michael,"Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one."
7207,Michael,Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
7208,Dwight,No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
7209,Dwight, I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
7210,Dwight, GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!
7211,Michael,I'm not going to give it to you.
7212,Michael,"Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. ""Outside Hire."""
7213,Angela,"Or Mrs. ""Outside Hire."""
7214,Michael,"Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor."
7215,Michael,God! He's a comedian.
7216,Michael,"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got."
7217,Jim,"Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement."
7218,Michael,You are being too modest.
7219,Jim,"Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York."
7220,Michael,"Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us."
7221,Dwight,"The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, ""Describe your act."" And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, ""What do you call yourselves?"" And the man says, ""The Aristocrats!"""
7222,Pam," Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh..."
7223,Dwight, I mean truly repulsive acts.
7224,Michael,"That is a very, very funny story."
7225,Pam," Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day."
7226,Michael,"Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background."
7227,Michael,Are we all set?
7228,Michael,"Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello."
7229,Michael,Thought I'd catch a show.
7230,Michael,"Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job."
7231,Michael,"Um, how many people are you interviewing?"
7232,Michael,"Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?"
7233,Michael,Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
7234,Michael,"Ah, great. No further questions."
7235,Michael,And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
7236,Michael,"I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late."
7237,Kevin,What's different about you? You look worse.
7238,Andy,"Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut."
7239,Andy,"What is it, Big Haircut?"
7240,Andy,"Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut."
7241,Jim,"Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless."
7242,Pam,Hey. I think it looks great.
7243,Pam,"After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so  thank you."
7244,Dwight,You wanted to see me?
7245,Michael,"Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute."
7246,Dwight,"But that's my name.  Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch.  Thank you."
7247,Dwight, Thank you so much.
7248,Pam,"Um, about the beach..."
7249,Pam,"Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird."
7250,Jim,"Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it."
7251,Jim,So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
7252,Michael,Why so you can do it?
7253,Michael,"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger..."
7254,Jim,"Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?"
7255,Kevin,"So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?"
7256,Jim,"Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now."
7257,Kevin,"Yes. She has bigger breasts, too."
7258,Kevin,I think Karen has a prettier face.
7259,Jim,"Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else?"
7260,Kevin,Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
7261,Jim,Hm. Really tough call.
7262,Jim,"You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got."
7263,Oscar,"Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. "
7264,Ryan,Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
7265,Michael,"There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks."
7266,Kevin,Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
7267,Michael,"No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me."
7268,Oscar,Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
7269,Michael,"No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo."
7270,Oscar,"I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense."
7271,Angela,Wha? Who gave you that advice?
7272,Kevin,"Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo..."
7273,Michael,I have to buy another place.
7274,Angela,But you said you were in debt. 
7275,Oscar,You're not sure that you have the job.
7276,Michael,"I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time."
7277,Dwight,"How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?"
7278,Angela,"No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome."
7279,Dwight,"No, no, not Michael.  Me. I'm taking his job."
7280,Angela," Not now.  Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor."
7281,Dwight," Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim."
7282,Dwight,I am gonna be your new boss.  It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.
7283,Jim,Does my room have cable?
7284,Dwight,No. And the sheets are made of fire.
7285,Jim,Can I change rooms?
7286,Dwight,"Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town."
7287,Jim,Can I have a late checkout?
7288,Dwight,I'll have to talk to the manager.
7289,Jim,You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
7290,Dwight,I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!
7291,Jim,"Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?"
7292,Dwight,"Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet."
7293,Dwight,Eighty thousand dollars a year.
7294,Dwight,Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
7295,Andy, I will see you at the inter-view.
7296,Michael,Who is D. Abramson?
7297,Pam,He's from that company in Pitts...
7298,Michael,Why... are you here?
7299,Michael,"I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you."
7300,Michael,"Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of."
7301,Michael,"Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem."
7302,Pam,What do you want me to do?
7303,Michael,"Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen."
7304,Michael,No. She's an alternate.
7305,Michael,"So, how you been?"
7306,Michael,"Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages."
7307,Pam,"So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room."
7308,Pam,I really hope you get the job.
7309,Michael,Sound good. Sounds fun.
7310,Michael,Would you excuse me for a second?
7311,Michael,Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.
7312,Michael,"I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please..."
7313,Michael,"No, no. What do I do?"
7314,Pam,Just don't get back together with her.
7315,Michael,What if she makes me?
7316,Angela,How can she make you get back together with her?
7317,Michael,She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
7318,Pam,This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
7319,Pam,You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
7320,Michael,You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
7321,Michael,I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
7322,Michael," Okay.  Jan, we need to talk. "
7323,Michael,"Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out."
7324,Jim,She could put the cup right there.
7325,Kevin,"I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers."
7326,Michael,Let's get back together. 
7327,Dwight,"Okay, everyone, listen up!  Time to begin the interview process!  Andrew Bernard."
7328,Andy,Saving the best for first!
7329,Dwight,"No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael."
7330,Oscar,"Good luck, you guys! "
7331,Dwight,What did I say!?
7332,Pam,"I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am.  That's Popeye."
7333,Dwight,I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?
7334,Andy,"White, because it contains all other colors."
7335,Dwight,Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?
7336,Andy,"You make a chair, but you don't sit on it."
7337,Dwight,What is the capital of Maine?
7338,Andy,"The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell."
7339,Dwight,"Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company."
7340,Andy,Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
7341,Dwight,"You're not off to a very good start, Bernard."
7342,Andy,"I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?"
7343,Andy,"I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous."
7344,Dwight," Time! No, you failed."
7345,Dwight,This interview is over. I'll let you know.
7346,Jim,"Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or..."
7347,Jim,"Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish?"
7348,Michael,"Wait, wait. Check one more time."
7349,Michael,"So, I guess we're getting back together."
7350,Michael,"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger."
7351,Michael,"Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery."
7352,Jim,"Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?"
7353,Jim,"Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip."
7354,Michael,"Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  I would like to start saying my goodbyes  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck."
7355,Dwight, Who's ready to work?
7356,Jim," Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels."
7357,Jim,Oh do you mean when I get the job?
7358,Jim,"Yeah, I do. C'mon. "
7359,Michael, How are you guys doing? Need anything?
7360,Michael,"I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me."
7361,Jim,I'm gonna introduce myself.
7362,Michael,"No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so..."
7363,Michael,"I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep."
7364,Andy,Hail to the chief!
7365,Dwight,My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
7366,Andy,My first order of business: accept.
7367,Dwight,As if you had a choice.  Duh.  Opportunity of a lifetime. 
7368,Andy,"Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. "
7369,Michael,"Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire."
7370,Michael,"Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?"
7371,Michael,"Just say, ""I want to squeeze them."" It's code. She'll know what it means."
7372,Michael,"Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her,  ""Brbrbrbrbr!"" also?"
7373,Dwight,You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
7374,Dwight,"I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager."
7375,Dwight,"Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position."
7376,Pam,You will be your own assistant.
7377,Dwight,"Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills."
7378,Pam,"I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, ""Absolutely, I do."""
7379,Michael,Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
7380,Michael,Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
7381,Michael,"Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths."
7382,Oscar,"Oh, Michael's not going anywhere."
7383,Pam,Then who do you think will get the job?
7384,Kevin,Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.
7385,Oscar,Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
7386,Dwight,"Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This...  is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch."
7387,Pam, What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
7388,Dwight,"Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent."
7389,Dwight,Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!
7390,Dwight,"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper."
7391,Kevin, Do we have to?
7392,Dwight,"Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is ""me."" Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!"
7393,Pam,I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.
7394,Michael,"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, ""Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, ""Super Duper Paper. It's super duper."" I don't know, something like that."
7395,Michael,"Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals."
7396,Michael,"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?"
7397,Dwight,Trees! And where do trees grow?
7398,Dwight,"Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right?  Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?"
7399,Dwight,Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.
7400,Dwight,Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
7401,Dwight,We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
7402,Dwight,What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
7403,Andy,"Class is canceled, everybody out!"
7404,Dwight,"No wait, what are you doing?!"
7405,Dwight,"No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled."
7406,Pam,HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! 
7407,Oscar,What--- What are you winking for?
7408,Michael,Could have gone better I guess.
7409,Michael,Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
7410,Michael,"Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun."
7411,Michael,I can't tell you.
7412,Michael,"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---"
7413,Michael,No--- We're all unstable.
7414,Michael,"David, I did not tell her."
7415,Andy,"It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall."
7416,Dwight,"It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. "
7417,Andy,This is gonna look so awesome!
7418,Dwight,"It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!"
7419,Michael,"So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job."
7420,Michael,"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions."
7421,Michael,"You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?"
7422,Michael,"Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though."
7423,Michael,Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
7424,Jim,Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.
7425,Jim,"Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want."
7426,Michael,"I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible."
7427,Michael,"Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK."
7428,Michael, I don't know.  Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale.  Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
7429,Michael, I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!
7430,Michael,"No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon."
7431,Michael,"Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. ""Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in."" Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?"
7432,Dwight,To intimidate my subordinates.
7433,Dwight,It was Andy's idea.
7434,Michael,"You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  Ryan, coffee."
7435,Ryan,I don't do that stuff anymore.
7436,Michael,"No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids."
7437,Michael,"So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones."
7438,Pam,Did... Karen get the job?
7439,Michael, Back to work.  Still waitin' on that coffee.
7440,Dwight,"I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity. "
7441,Pam,"No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay."
7442,Jim,"I'm sorry, wait, so is the question ""How'd I get to be so awesome?""  Because, I don't have an answer for you. "
7443,Jim," What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a  energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  So that's a... bonus."
7444,Jim, How are your feet?
7445,Jim,The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
7446,Jim,"And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back."
7447,Pam,"Well, I wish you would."
7448,Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you."
7449,Pam,"I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally--- "
7450,Jim,"Pam.  Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight?"
7451,Jim,All right. Then... it's a date.
7452,Pam," I'm sorry, what was the question?"
7453,Ryan, I'm excited too. Okay. Bye.
7454,Ryan, Nobody. You and I are done.
7455,Michael,"Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy.  This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to.  She probably won't be up for a few hours."
7456,Michael,This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. 
7457,Pam,It was for a video.
7458,Pam,A celebrity s*x tape.
7459,Jim,"Really, what kind of celebrity?"
7460,Jim,How much did you pay for it?
7461,Jim,You paid for it?
7462,Pam,It all happened so fast.
7463,Jim,"I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody."
7464,Pam,Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
7465,Kevin,"Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? "
7466,Oscar,"I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things."
7467,Kevin,Are you kidding me?
7468,Pam,And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
7469,Jim,Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
7470,Pam,Well have fun with that.
7471,Michael,Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
7472,Michael,"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK."
7473,Oscar,So she's really going to be fine?
7474,Michael,"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse."
7475,Pam,Thank God you were there.
7476,Andy,Did you see who did it?
7477,Dwight,No need we can just check the security tapes.
7478,Michael,Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
7479,Jim,One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
7480,Michael,"Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something."
7481,Dwight,Hey... Why did you do it?
7482,Michael,It was an accident.
7483,Dwight,Was she talkin' back?
7484,Dwight,Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
7485,Pam,"Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers."
7486,Kevin,"Who's we, you and Jim?"
7487,Pam,"No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far."
7488,Kevin,"Oh, I bet Jim goes too."
7489,Pam,"Yeah, I haven't asked him yet."
7490,Kevin,"Oh, I bet you ask?"
7491,Pam,I was planning on it.
7492,Kevin,I bet you were.
7493,Angela,"I can't, Sprinkles is sick."
7494,Angela,"She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles."
7495,Angela,"I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?"
7496,Pam,Can't your other cats keep her company.
7497,Angela,"There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques."
7498,Pam,"Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job."
7499,Michael,My lord my liege.
7500,Michael,"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?"
7501,Michael,So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
7502,Ryan,Back? Why is that Michael?
7503,Michael,"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car."
7504,Ryan,Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
7505,Michael,"No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in..."
7506,Ryan,Did this happen on company property?
7507,Michael,"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine."
7508,Ryan,I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
7509,Michael,"Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?"
7510,Ryan,"People keep calling me a ""Wunderkind""; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word."
7511,Dwight,"Hey monkey, what's up?"
7512,Angela,Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
7513,Angela,I have to visit the alchy.
7514,Dwight,"Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp."
7515,Angela,I wouldn't put it past her.
7516,Dwight,So what do you need me to do?
7517,Angela,I wrote it out.
7518,Angela,"There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail."
7519,Michael,"Ok, I have an announcement."
7520,Oscar,You pushed Darryl out the window?
7521,Michael,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree."
7522,Jim,"Oh good, so we don't have to work."
7523,Pam,"OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1."
7524,Michael,"So, like a freedom tree."
7525,Pam,I can take 3 people.
7526,Jim,I can also take 3 people.
7527,Pam,"Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room."
7528,Pam,Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
7529,Michael,"Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch."
7530,Pam,I was thinking that we...
7531,Michael,"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?"
7532,Michael,"Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!"
7533,Michael,"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make."
7534,Michael,Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
7535,Michael,"No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault."
7536,Jim,I think she's awake.
7537,Michael,No... She's in a coma.
7538,Michael,"OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear."
7539,Michael,"Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!"
7540,Michael, I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
7541,Jim,I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
7542,Michael,"Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody."
7543,Michael,Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
7544,Angela,"No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness."
7545,Michael,"Well, just shhhh... just just..."
7546,Michael,"Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug."
7547,Michael,Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
7548,Dwight,"Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead."
7549,Dwight,"Sparkles, the white one, is dead."
7550,Dwight,"That was the sick one, right?"
7551,Angela,Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
7552,Angela,Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
7553,Dwight,Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
7554,Dwight,"So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place."
7555,Dwight,"Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor."
7556,Pam, It's gonna be OK.
7557,Michael,"OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just..."
7558,Pam,"Michael, Angela's cat died."
7559,Michael," Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the p0rn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it."
7560,Michael,"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious."
7561,Michael,Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
7562,Michael,Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
7563,Michael,Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
7564,Angela,Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
7565,Dwight,She's only a cat.
7566,Angela,You never... you don't like them.
7567,Dwight,Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
7568,Michael,"Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?"
7569,Dwight,"No, I have not."
7570,Michael,"Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects."
7571,Dwight,"I do not respect her, but I will go."
7572,Michael,"Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs."
7573,Michael,Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
7574,Michael,"Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in."
7575,Angela,That's why we're cursed.
7576,Michael,"Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha."
7577,Michael,"OK, 1 Sikh, and..."
7578,Dwight,"As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical."
7579,Dwight,Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
7580,Dwight,"Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?"
7581,Dwight,"Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one."
7582,Dwight,Just doing my job.
7583,Michael,"You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.  And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead."
7584,Michael,"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine."
7585,Jim,I will do some research.
7586,Pam,I can help you with that.
7587,Dwight,"So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine."
7588,Michael,"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?"
7589,Dwight,"No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something."
7590,Michael,This place is so cursed.
7591,Dwight,"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw."
7592,Michael," I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it."
7593,Jim,"Six of one, really."
7594,Michael,"Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished."
7595,Michael,"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?"
7596,Kevin," Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!"
7597,Pam," I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers.  Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be.  Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know."
7598,Pam,"Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam."
7599,Pam,Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
7600,Michael,"A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that."
7601,Michael,"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?"
7602,Michael,"Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00."
7603,Andy,Isn't that your money?
7604,Michael,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?"
7605,Michael,"Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis."
7606,Kevin,You cannot make me run.
7607,Kevin,"It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it."
7608,Kevin,You didn't run for me...
7609,Kevin,...when I thought I had skin cancer.
7610,Michael,I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
7611,Michael,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant."
7612,Kevin,I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
7613,Michael,"Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore."
7614,Andy," I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. "
7615,Andy,"Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. "
7616,Angela,"This is Sprinkles.  She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year,  just a couple of kittens  out on the town."
7617,Angela,"Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice."
7618,Angela,"I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat."
7619,Angela,"When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds."
7620,Angela,Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
7621,Angela,Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
7622,Pam,I'm more of a dog person.
7623,Jim,So what's your strategy for this race?
7624,Pam,Well I'm gonna start fast.
7625,Pam,Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
7626,Pam,Then I'm gonna end fast.
7627,Jim,Why won't more people do that? 
7628,Pam,Cause they're just stupid.
7629,Jim," Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah..."
7630,Pam,Yeah... That was um...
7631,Jim,"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything."
7632,Pam,"Yeah, I gave him a ride home because..."
7633,Jim,Wow! There it is.
7634,Pam,"Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great.  Right?"
7635,Jim,It is going really great.
7636,Dwight,"You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger."
7637,Dwight, You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
7638,Angela, I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
7639,Michael,"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?"
7640,Pam,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?"
7641,Michael,Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
7642,Jim,"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check."
7643,Pam,Giant check it is.
7644,Dwight,"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control."
7645,Dwight,"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed."
7646,Michael,You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
7647,Pam,"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check."
7648,Pam,And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
7649,Michael,What about a rabies nurse?
7650,Pam,I don't think so.
7651,Jim,"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events."
7652,Michael,That's possible. Look into that.
7653,Jim,"Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips."
7654,Dwight,Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
7655,Michael,Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
7656,Pam,"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. "
7657,Michael,What are you doing?
7658,Pam,You said come in!
7659,Michael,"No I didn't, just please don't..."
7660,Pam,So I closed the door but the image of his...
7661,Pam,... still burned in my eyes.
7662,Michael,May I enter the room?
7663,Pam,Yes. Or come in.
7664,Michael,See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
7665,Jim,You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
7666,Michael,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that."
7667,Pam,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark."
7668,Michael,European offices are naked all the time.
7669,Michael,Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
7670,Pam,I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
7671,Michael,"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun."
7672,Pam,They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
7673,Jim," Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?"
7674,Michael,"Check that out.  Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?"
7675,Pam,"What? Look, no it was not..."
7676,Michael,"OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing."
7677,Darryl, I'm giving him a peanut.
7678,Michael,"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?"
7679,Darryl,Look how happy he is.
7680,Michael,"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse?  This is the reason we're here."
7681,Michael,"Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?"
7682,Michael,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands."
7683,Michael,"OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load."
7684,Michael,"Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing."
7685,Dwight,"On your marks, get set..."
7686,Oscar,"You're doing great Michael, look at you go!"
7687,Michael,"I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. "
7688,Andy,"I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. "
7689,Pam,Yeah.  Oh we're in last place.
7690,Jim,"Oh, would you look at that."
7691,Michael,"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!"
7692,Michael,Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
7693,Andy,"Oh God! My nipples, it's starting."
7694,Michael,That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
7695,Dwight,"You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race."
7696,Michael," Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?"
7697,Jim,Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
7698,Pam,I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
7699,Jim,"OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured."
7700,Jim,That's what I thought.
7701,Jim,Right. Let's do some good.
7702,Ryan,"  for the cure...  leave a message"" Ryan hangs up]"
7703,Michael," Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. "
7704,Andy," Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin."
7705,Dwight,"How ya feeling, better?"
7706,Dwight,Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
7707,Angela,The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
7708,Dwight,I am a farmer Angela.
7709,Angela,What does that mean?
7710,Dwight,"OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do."
7711,Angela,You did kill her!?
7712,Dwight,"I... I sang her, her favorite songs."
7713,Angela,You put her in my freezer.
7714,Dwight,It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
7715,Angela,Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
7716,Dwight,Well I'm not responsible for that!
7717,Dwight,"Hey, Oww!  It's OK."
7718,Dwight,"It's nothing, I'm robbing her."
7719,Angela,How could you do that without telling me?
7720,Dwight,"I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how."
7721,Angela,"Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized."
7722,Dwight,"I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good."
7723,Michael, Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
7724,Dwight,"Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?"
7725,Angela,Don't touch me Dwight! 
7726,Pam," You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00."
7727,Jim,"Oh, and I get to carry it."
7728,Michael," I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. "
7729,Pam,"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?"
7730,Jim,"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or..."
7731,Michael,"I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just..."
7732,Jim,"Well, you're probably dehydrated."
7733,Michael,What do you want me to do Jim?
7734,Jim,Glass of water would be a start.
7735,Michael,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins."
7736,Jim,Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
7737,Pam,I'm still having a nice day.
7738,Pam,"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00."
7739,Michael,That's a good deal.
7740,Pam,"And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much."
7741,Michael,"Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done."
7742,Pam,"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping."
7743,Michael,"You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference."
7744,Pam,"I know you Michael, I saw you naked."
7745,Michael,"You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my pen1s. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no!"
7746,Michael,"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that."
7747,Michael,Hey Mer. How ya doing?
7748,Michael,"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water."
7749,Michael,"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?"
7750,Michael,"I'm not really sick.  Nah, I'm good."
7751,Jim,"Oh wow, thank you."
7752,Jim,"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?"
7753,Pam,"No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?"
7754,Jim,I guess.  How dare you.
7755,Michael,Hey Toby. What's this? 
7756,Michael, I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
7757,Michael,"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight..."
7758,Angela," For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity."
7759,Jim,"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are."
7760,Michael,You guys! Yes! Yes!
7761,Pam,"Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?"
7762,Michael,"Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one."
7763,Jim,"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months."
7764,Michael,"I love you guys, so much. "
7765,Michael,"No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest."
7766,Dwight,I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
7767,Angela,It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
7768,Andy,Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
7769,Michael,Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
7770,Pam, Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
7771,Michael,Blowing up balloons I thought.
7772,Pam,You might want to trim it a little.
7773,Michael,Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
7774,Angela,What do you want?
7775,Dwight,To give you this .
7776,Angela,"Oh, what is that?"
7777,Dwight,It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
7778,Angela,Her name was Sprinkles.
7779,Dwight,And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage.  Don't you Garbage? 
7780,Angela,I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
7781,Dwight,You haven't buried her yet?
7782,Angela,Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
7783,Dwight,"Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons.  Look at him."
7784,Angela,I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! 
7785,Jim,"Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company."
7786,Pam,"Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. "
7787,Jim,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?"
7788,Pam, Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
7789,Ryan,Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
7790,Michael,"There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs."
7791,Ryan,OK. Should we get started?
7792,Michael,"Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.."
7793,Ryan,"Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting."
7794,Ryan,Stop that! Stop that!
7795,Michael,That's right! That's right!
7796,Michael,"Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan."
7797,Kevin,You weren't here for that.
7798,Kevin,When he started the fire.
7799,Michael,"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man..."
7800,Kevin,Little old man boy.
7801,Ryan,"Michael and everybody, umm..."
7802,Ryan,"...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan."
7803,Michael,That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
7804,Michael,Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
7805,Ryan,Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?
7806,Michael,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?"
7807,Michael,"Sounds good. OK, alright."
7808,Michael,"Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, ""Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you."" His words."
7809,Ryan,Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
7810,Jim,"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. "
7811,Ryan,This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
7812,Michael,"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme."
7813,Ryan,I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
7814,Dwight,What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
7815,Ryan,"This is company-wide, Dwight."
7816,Andy,"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?"
7817,Ryan,Any other questions?  Kelly Kapoor.
7818,Michael,Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job. 
7819,Ryan,"As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system."
7820,Michael,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
7821,Jim,"Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months."
7822,Jim,"Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun."
7823,Pam,"No, they have been dating for like two years.  Since before your barbeque."
7824,Jim,Wait. What?  You knew? And you didn't say anything?
7825,Pam,You didn't say anything to me?
7826,Jim,Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
7827,Pam,Can you believe that...
7828,Jim,"Oh no, we're just sitting here."
7829,Jim,And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
7830,Michael,"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?"
7831,Ryan,"Well it is business, but not as usual."
7832,Michael,"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?"
7833,Ryan,"No.  We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system."
7834,Michael,"Good, so, we're on the same page?"
7835,Ryan,"No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself."
7836,Michael,"We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans."
7837,Ryan,"So, how are you?"
7838,Ryan,"Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend."
7839,Ryan,"I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship."
7840,Ryan,"I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?"
7841,Angela,"Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?"
7842,Dwight,"I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side."
7843,Angela,I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
7844,Pam,In his office. You can go right in.
7845,Ryan,"So elephant in the room, I have your old job."
7846,Ryan,"Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities."
7847,Ryan,Well... you look great.
7848,Ryan,You were let go.
7849,Michael," Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?"
7850,Michael,I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
7851,Michael,"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people."
7852,Michael,What is that... word?
7853,Michael,So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
7854,Ryan,"Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here."
7855,Pam,Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
7856,Michael,"Good, we're all here, we can get started."
7857,Ryan,We're not doing this today.
7858,Michael,Have a seat. Like everybody else.
7859,Michael,"Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did."
7860,Michael,"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?"
7861,Michael,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like ""where's the Beef?""   Yeah."
7862,Jim,"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot."
7863,Pam,"Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too."
7864,Michael,"I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone."
7865,Michael," That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? "
7866,Ryan,"Michael,  can I talk to you a second?"
7867,Michael,Sure thing.  'Scuse me. 
7868,Ryan,We have actual work to do.
7869,Michael,Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. 
7870,Michael,"Bob, how old are you?"
7871,Michael,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?"
7872,Michael,"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you."
7873,Dwight,"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation."
7874,Michael,That's great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
7875,Michael,"Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. "
7876,Pam,I think that I should help him get home.
7877,Michael,"No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam.  What a nice guy."
7878,Ryan,"Well, today was a fantastic waste of time."
7879,Michael,"I disagree, I think it was very valuable."
7880,Ryan,"Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving."
7881,Michael,I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
7882,Ryan,Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas.   Where do you wanna go?
7883,Dwight,Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
7884,Angela,Very much. How's your meat?
7885,Angela,I heard a joke today.
7886,Dwight,Are you enjoying your mineral water?
7887,Angela,I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
7888,Dwight,"Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here , it's an old sales trick."
7889,Angela,I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
7890,Dwight,"No, please don't do this, monkey."
7891,Angela,I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. 
7892,Jim,"Hey, Amy. How ya doing?"
7893,Pam,Nice to meet you.
7894,Jim, Nice to meet you.
7895,Pam,"Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo."
7896,Michael,Smell that. Do you smell that?
7897,Michael,"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer."
7898,Andy,"Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles."
7899,Michael,"Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later."
7900,Michael,"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food."
7901,Dwight,"Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items."
7902,Dwight,Yes...  I miss you.
7903,Angela,"Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?"
7904,Dwight,Fine.  Then I just want to be friends.
7905,Dwight,"Plus a little extra. Also, I love you."
7906,Ryan,You lied about being pregnant.
7907,Ryan,You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
7908,Ryan,We're never getting back together.
7909,Jim,"Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?"
7910,Pam,It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
7911,Jim,"I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?"
7912,Pam,"I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but..."
7913,Pam,I now find you repulsive.
7914,Jim,"That's honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?"
7915,Jim,"For me, it was."
7916,Michael,"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today."
7917,Ryan,"What's, uh, going on here?"
7918,Michael,"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back."
7919,Michael,"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like."
7920,Michael,"Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. ""You can't be on the team"", ""You can't move on to second grade"". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class."
7921,Michael,"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy."
7922,Andy,I'll go with you Stanley.
7923,Jim,Why don't we just go by ourselves?
7924,Michael,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
7925,Michael,"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis."
7926,Michael,"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve."
7927,Andy,"What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever."
7928,Jim,What about a gift basket full of cash?
7929,Andy,Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
7930,Michael,"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. "
7931,Dwight,"Michael, wait. Let me go."
7932,Michael,"No, this is my quest."
7933,Dwight,"Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please."
7934,Michael,Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
7935,Michael,We don't need luck.
7936,Michael,"But thank you, that was really nice of you to say."
7937,Michael,"Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people."
7938,Ryan," Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing."
7939,Dwight," Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?"
7940,Michael,It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
7941,Dwight,"Ah, that's a pain in the ass."
7942,Michael,I know. So who's next?
7943,Dwight,Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
7944,Dwight,Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
7945,Dwight,"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. "
7946,Ryan,"Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night.  I run into Vince Vaughn."
7947,Andy,"Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do."
7948,Kevin,"Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?"
7949,Jim,"Yeah, he's definitely something."
7950,Kevin,What does that mean?
7951,Jim,"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?"
7952,Andy,Ha! Tuna...  Tuna Tuna Tuna.
7953,Andy,"He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes."
7954,Kevin,And he can get any girl that he wants.
7955,Andy,"So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons."
7956,Kevin,Tuna. Check you later.
7957,Michael," Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?"
7958,Dwight,"Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you."
7959,Dwight,"And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us."
7960,Michael,"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch."
7961,Dwight,Remember what we had Larry?
7962,Michael,"Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket."
7963,Michael, That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
7964,Dwight,I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
7965,Dwight,Like Angela in accounting.
7966,Michael,"Yes, she is nuts."
7967,Dwight,"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy."
7968,Michael,How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
7969,Ryan,Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
7970,Ryan,"Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?"
7971,Ryan,Thank you very much.
7972,Pam,"Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames.  I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited."
7973,Michael,"And the last guy says ""No, hairy body""."
7974,Michael,"Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?"
7975,Michael,"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider."
7976,Michael,"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?"
7977,Michael,Ah... .is that all you have to say?
7978,Michael,"Look, we want you back."
7979,Dwight,"He's not coming back, it's over Michael."
7980,Dwight,"Accept it, why would he come back?"
7981,Michael,"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us."
7982,Dwight,That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
7983,Michael,"Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier."
7984,Michael,"Great, the magic of the gift basket."
7985,Michael,"OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic."
7986,Dwight," Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side."
7987,Michael,"I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing."
7988,Dwight,"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you."
7989,Michael,"That is a very good point, Dwight."
7990,Dwight,"Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there."
7991,Michael,"No, it said right, it said take a right."
7992,Dwight,"No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307."
7993,Michael,Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. 
7994,Dwight,It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
7995,Michael,The machine knows where it is going!
7996,Dwight,This is the lake!
7997,Michael,The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
7998,Dwight,"No, it's--- there's no road here! "
7999,Dwight,"Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Okay, exit the window!  Here we go! Look out for leeches!  Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you!  Michael! Michael!"
8000,Michael,"Let go, let go of me!"
8001,Dwight,"I got you, I got you! "
8002,Michael, You sure you're OK?
8003,Michael,"Good, that is what's most important."
8004,Dwight,Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
8005,Michael,"What a disaster, this whole thing."
8006,Dwight,I'll call a cab. 
8007,Michael,"These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it."
8008,Dwight,"Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone."
8009,Michael,"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. ""I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy"". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us."
8010,Dwight," Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake."
8011,Michael,Hang up.  You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
8012,Michael,"We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!"
8013,Pam,"So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo."
8014,Ryan,"I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff."
8015,Ryan,I'd love to talk to you about it more.
8016,Ryan,Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
8017,Ryan,I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
8018,Pam,"I'm uh, I'm dating Jim."
8019,Ryan,"That's... great, I... that's awesome."
8020,Ryan," So let me um, let me look at these."
8021,Jim,I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
8022,Michael,"Give it back. The gift basket, give it back."
8023,Dwight,"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket."
8024,Michael,"Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! "
8025,Dwight,"Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna  Oops, sorry!"
8026,Michael,"Look, my clothes are so wet!"
8027,Dwight,"Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! "
8028,Michael,What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
8029,Michael,WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
8030,Dwight," Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!"
8031,Michael,"May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now."
8032,Ryan,That is not correct.
8033,Michael,Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
8034,Michael,"I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me."
8035,Michael,"Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game."
8036,Michael,"Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy."
8037,Ryan,"I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars."
8038,Ryan,You should come visit. The city is... amazing.
8039,Jim,I know. I love it there.
8040,Ryan,No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
8041,Jim,"Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun."
8042,Ryan,"No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless."
8043,Ryan,No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
8044,Jim,Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
8045,Michael,"And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination."
8046,Jim,"There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it."
8047,Pam,"I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!"
8048,Michael,We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? 
8049,Michael,Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
8050,Oscar,It's never gonna happen.
8051,Kevin,"Dude, you gotta believe."
8052,Michael,"Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?"
8053,Michael,"Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a ""Where's Waldo."" "
8054,Michael, Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.
8055,Kevin,That was so awesome.
8056,Michael,That was awesome. Thank you.
8057,Michael,Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?
8058,Jim,"Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?"
8059,Jim,"Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so..."
8060,Pam,Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
8061,Michael,"Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you."
8062,Jim,Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
8063,Michael,And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
8064,Michael,"Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen..."
8065,Michael,"The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight."
8066,Dwight,That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
8067,Jim,Actually it sounds like you are.
8068,Dwight,Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?
8069,Michael,No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.
8070,Dwight,"I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today."
8071,Angela,Waste of time. The website's going to win.
8072,Dwight,You believe a computer can beat me?
8073,Angela,"I don't care, but yes."
8074,Dwight,Well I will prove you wrong.
8075,Angela,"I don't care, and you won't."
8076,Angela,"I won't be watching, and I won't."
8077,Pam,Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
8078,Ryan,"Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest."
8079,Ryan,"Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun."
8080,Andy,And this is where I will record your sales.
8081,Dwight,Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.
8082,Andy,"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done."
8083,Andy,I can't tell if he's mocking me.
8084,Andy,"Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go."
8085,Dwight,I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
8086,Andy,Yes like a chime or a bell...
8087,Dwight,Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.
8088,Kevin,Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
8089,Angela,Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you?
8090,Angela,I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
8091,Angela,It is awful. You've made this day awful!
8092,Kevin,Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
8093,Angela,"Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?"
8094,Angela,It's supposed to say launch!
8095,Michael,"Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway."
8096,Angela,"Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead."
8097,Andy,Twenty seconds to go time.
8098,Dwight,Got it. Carb up.
8099,Dwight,"Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner."
8100,Dwight,"Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute."
8101,Jim,What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
8102,Dwight,Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
8103,Pam,He's going through a break-up.
8104,Jim,"Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person."
8105,Dwight,"Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines."
8106,Pam,What kind of prank are you thinking?
8107,Dwight,What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.
8108,Jim, Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
8109,Dwight,It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
8110,Pam,Yes it's too tight.
8111,Oscar,This is why I'm here?
8112,Michael,It's the European cut.
8113,Angela,Is just looks bad.
8114,Michael,"Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?"
8115,Michael,Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
8116,Michael,"I had um, one of those danishes."
8117,Pam,Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
8118,Pam,"Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan."
8119,Michael,Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.
8120,Michael,Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
8121,Michael,Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
8122,Michael,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
8123,Andy,Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.
8124,Andy,You my friend are in a very close second.
8125,Andy,"Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?"
8126,Michael,So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.
8127,Michael,Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
8128,Jim,Oh I'm sorry. What?
8129,Pam,One of the tickets is for him.
8130,Michael,Just let me know who the winner is.
8131,Jim,Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.
8132,Pam,Tie goes to the girlfriend.
8133,Dwight,"No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. "
8134,Jim,You look a little worried.
8135,Dwight,I do not look worried.
8136,Pam,"Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one."
8137,Jim,"Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper."
8138,Angela,I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.
8139,Angela,"Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?"
8140,Darryl,Kelly ordered this online.
8141,Dwight,What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
8142,Dwight,Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!
8143,Dwight,Return it! Return it now!
8144,Darryl,Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
8145,Dwight,"Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible."
8146,Darryl,So you still missing Ryan?
8147,Dwight,"I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them."
8148,Dwight,"Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good."
8149,Michael,Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
8150,Jim,"Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam."
8151,Michael,"Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you.  I love ya Pam... okay.  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?"
8152,Angela,Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
8153,Michael,"If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow."
8154,Dwight,Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
8155,Dwight,"I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?"
8156,Dwight,Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
8157,Angela,Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
8158,Dwight,Did you see the board?
8159,Angela,There's still an hour.
8160,Michael,You ever read this? 
8161,Jim,"Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it."
8162,Michael,"Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured..."
8163,Michael,Same sort of stuff in here.
8164,Jim,It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.
8165,Michael,One for me one for Jan.
8166,Michael,You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
8167,Jim,That would be fun.
8168,Michael,Wanna come over Friday?
8169,Michael,After work you guys...
8170,Jim,"Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?"
8171,Michael,"Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So..."
8172,Michael,What are you doing?
8173,Jim,"Uh, that is an invitation to an online party."
8174,Michael,"No, I'm sure that's not. Na..."
8175,Jim,"Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?"
8176,Michael,"Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan."
8177,Michael,You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
8178,Michael,Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
8179,Jim,Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
8180,Michael,Yeah. I withdrew too.
8181,Andy,Four! Three! Two! One!
8182,Andy,"After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams."
8183,Dwight,Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.
8184,Dwight,No no no the first part.
8185,Andy,Dwight has defeated the computer.
8186,Dwight,Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.
8187,Angela,I didn't ask you to do it for me.
8188,Dwight,You didn't have to.
8189,Angela,"How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?"
8190,Angela,Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.
8191,Pam,Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
8192,Michael,Alright who wants to party?
8193,Oscar,Why aren't you in New York?
8194,Michael,"Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out."
8195,Michael,I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
8196,Michael,Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?
8197,Andy,He beat the computer.
8198,Michael,Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
8199,Michael,"This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home."
8200,Michael,How we doing on time?
8201,Angela,The party starts in an hour.
8202,Michael,Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.
8203,Angela,"Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?"
8204,Angela,Something made of ice?
8205,Michael,Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.
8206,Angela,"Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?"
8207,Michael,"I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important..."
8208,Michael,"I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, ""Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"""
8209,Angela,I can't do this.
8210,Angela,I can't do it.
8211,Michael,Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?
8212,Michael,No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
8213,Andy,What do you think of Angela?
8214,Dwight,I think she's efficient.
8215,Andy,"No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N."
8216,Andy,You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
8217,Andy,"I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right?"
8218,Dwight,I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
8219,Andy,Isn't that part of the fun?
8220,Dwight,No. I think you should date Kelly.
8221,Andy,"She works here too, how is that any different?"
8222,Dwight,"Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby."
8223,Michael,"Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?"
8224,Kevin,Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?
8225,Michael,You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
8226,Kevin,"Oscar, talk to him."
8227,Oscar,"Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?"
8228,Michael,"Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?"
8229,Kevin,"Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage."
8230,Angela,It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
8231,Andy,Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box. 
8232,Andy,"Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box."
8233,Andy,"Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?"
8234,Angela,"I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again."
8235,Andy,"They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates."
8236,Pam,The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
8237,Michael,You don't have to say it like that.
8238,Pam,I said it normal.
8239,Michael,"Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty."
8240,Michael,"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas."
8241,Michael,You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
8242,Michael,"Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon."
8243,Michael, What do you mean hmm-um?
8244,Michael,"It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story."
8245,Michael,I'm not giving that to you.
8246,Michael,"No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out."
8247,Michael,"You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room."
8248,Michael,"Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you."
8249,Michael,"No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here."
8250,Kevin,We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
8251,Oscar,"Stanley, could you look up ""accomplices""?"
8252,Oscar,Because we're looking up jail time.
8253,Dwight,I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
8254,Michael,You ready to give me my discount now?
8255,Michael,"Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?"
8256,Dwight,We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.
8257,Michael,"Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man."
8258,Michael,"No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?"
8259,Michael,"Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales."
8260,Dwight,What did you just call him?
8261,Dwight,What did you say?
8262,Michael,"Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse."
8263,Dwight,"I can make him talk, Michael."
8264,Michael,Stop talking all at once!
8265,Jim,You need to let him go.
8266,Michael,Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
8267,Michael,"You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions."
8268,Jim,"Yes, but not by kidnapping."
8269,Michael,"I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want."
8270,Michael,I think you're over-thinking it.
8271,Jim,I think you're under-thinking it.
8272,Michael,"Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our..."
8273,Jim,What did he say?
8274,Jim,"So, we should let him go."
8275,Dwight,"Listen up kid.  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights."
8276,Angela,I have to hang these.
8277,Jim,Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
8278,Michael,"Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?"
8279,Kevin,"We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end."
8280,Angela,"I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour."
8281,Angela,That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
8282,Andy,"Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice."
8283,Angela,"How did you, um, where did you..."
8284,Dwight,"It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor."
8285,Angela,Will you help me put it over there?
8286,Pam,"Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself."
8287,Michael,I'll just wave and introduce myself.
8288,Jim,"Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?"
8289,Pam,I'm all over it.
8290,Jim,What have we got here?
8291,Jim,"Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?"
8292,Jim,Which one's this? Perfect.
8293,Jim,"Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?"
8294,Pam,"Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight."
8295,Jim,And that's when I knew. You?
8296,Pam,"You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired."
8297,Jim,That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
8298,Jim,"Wow, can we make it a different moment?"
8299,Ryan,"And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott."
8300,Michael,"Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole."
8301,Ryan,Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.
8302,Angela,Ow! What are you doing?
8303,Andy,You said your upper back itched.
8304,Angela,I didn't ask you to scratch it.
8305,Andy,"Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you."
8306,Angela,I'm not dating you.
8307,Andy,"So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested."
8308,Andy,"But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down."
8309,Dwight, If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
8310,Michael,"Hey, have you seen Jim?"
8311,Kevin,I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
8312,Michael,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?"
8313,Dwight,I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
8314,Dwight,"Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!"
8315,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid."
8316,Dwight,"You had to, what other choice did you have?"
8317,Michael,I could have paid for the pizza.
8318,Michael,"Oh my God, oh my God."
8319,Ryan,"Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out."
8320,Michael,You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
8321,Ryan,Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... 
8322,Michael," Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent."
8323,Dwight,What will you do?
8324,Michael,I will open the door.
8325,Michael,"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands."
8326,Dwight,"So, I'm paying full price?"
8327,Dwight,"Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more."
8328,Michael,"See ya, drive safely."
8329,Michael,"Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens."
8330,Dwight,"Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas."
8331,Michael,"Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time."
8332,Jim,"A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge."
8333,Andy," Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on."
8334,Andy," If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me."
8335,Andy,"I don't know yet, I have to call you back."
8336,Andy,I'll call you back.
8337,Angela,I have to go clean up after the party.
8338,Michael,What a horrible day.
8339,Michael,"Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?"
8340,Michael,I'm going to get it.
8341,Michael,"Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi."
8342,Michael,New York. Wanna go?
8343,Michael,"Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let's go."
8344,Michael,"Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer."
8345,Michael," I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face."
8346,Dwight,And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
8347,Michael,"I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot."
8348,Dwight,I started a fire with my cheese pita.
8349,Michael,I made it with my cheese pita.
8350,Dwight,I date Indian girls.
8351,Michael,"I started a fire, I started a fire."
8352,Dwight,"Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss."
8353,Michael,"And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody..."
8354,Dwight,"I don't get that, I don't understand that."
8355,Michael,"Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh."
8356,Pam,"Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow."
8357,Michael,Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
8358,Pam,"He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character."
8359,Pam,Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
8360,Michael,Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. 
8361,Michael,I owe you an apology.
8362,Pam,You finished the movie.
8363,Michael,Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
8364,Michael,"Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle."
8365,Pam,Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
8366,Michael,I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
8367,Michael,We already have a sofa. So why do---
8368,Michael,It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
8369,Michael,I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
8370,Michael,"Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise."
8371,Michael,It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- 
8372,Pam," Michael, it's Ryan for you."
8373,Michael,"Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!"
8374,Ryan, I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
8375,Michael,"Yes, and thank you for sending that to me."
8376,Ryan,I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
8377,Michael,"Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up."
8378,Ryan,"Hold on, I'll get them on the phone."
8379,Michael," Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it."
8380,Jim," Sure, I can hold."
8381,Dwight," Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold.  Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!"
8382,Dwight,"None of your business, Jim."
8383,Jim,Do you run the bed and breakfest?
8384,Dwight,It is not a B and B.
8385,Dwight,"Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest."
8386,Jim,Does the Department of Health know about this?
8387,Dwight,"I'm not telling you anything.  Permits are pending.  Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin."
8388,Pam,"Hello, I'm looking for a room."
8389,Dwight,"Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones."
8390,Pam,It says here you cater to the eldery.
8391,Dwight,Where did you read that?
8392,Dwight,"Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see."
8393,Dwight,How many in your party?
8394,Dwight,"We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?"
8395,Michael,"Oh! Um, actually, I need the car."
8396,Michael,"Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her."
8397,Dwight,"One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask."
8398,Angela,What about my cherub figurine?
8399,Dwight,You took that with you.
8400,Angela,"No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp."
8401,Dwight,"You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there."
8402,Dwight,"My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats."
8403,Kevin,"The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?"
8404,Michael,"You can not, I have a thing tonight."
8405,Jim,"That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight."
8406,Michael,"Oh no, I have a thing tonight."
8407,Michael,How about this weekend?
8408,Pam,"We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you."
8409,Michael,"Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right."
8410,Jim,Where are you going out tonight?
8411,Michael,You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
8412,Jim,I wouldn't understand or a secret?
8413,Pam,"You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret."
8414,Michael,"I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy."
8415,Jim,"I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow."
8416,Jim,"The Beets Motel? That is, wow."
8417,Pam,Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
8418,Jim,How are you doing this?
8419,Michael,"I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing."
8420,Michael,"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call."
8421,Michael,"No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!"
8422,Dwight,"We have three rooms, each with a different theme."
8423,Pam,What are the themes?
8424,Dwight,"American, Irrigation, and Night-Time."
8425,Dwight,"I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?"
8426,Jim,Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
8427,Jim,Not even Harry Potter?
8428,Dwight,"No. Jim, come on."
8429,Dwight,"Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty."
8430,Michael,These meetings are useless.
8431,Michael,Or a trained seal. 
8432,Jim,"Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6."
8433,Jim,"Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight."
8434,Jim,"You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less."
8435,Dwight,"Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!"
8436,Michael,"Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?"
8437,Michael,I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
8438,Michael," Senor, are you happy with your---"
8439,Michael, Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
8440,Michael,Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
8441,Michael,"Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---"
8442,Michael,It is not a waste of our time.
8443,Michael,Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
8444,Michael,"Well, I hope this conversation has helped."
8445,Dwight," And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. ""Harry?"" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing."
8446,Michael,What did you get tonight?
8447,Michael,"Oh, that looks good."
8448,Michael,I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
8449,Michael,Wonder what I would've been back home?
8450,Michael,"I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something."
8451,Michael,I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
8452,Jim," Wait, you're going up there?"
8453,Pam, Oh my God. What century is this?
8454,Michael,"You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator."
8455,Michael,I actually wrote a movie.
8456,Michael,"I'm writing one, yeah."
8457,Michael,"Um, sort of a spy, thriller..."
8458,Dwight, Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
8459,Dwight,"Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose."
8460,Jim,Does Mose have nightmares?
8461,Jim,Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
8462,Dwight,Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
8463,Jim,"Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here."
8464,Dwight,Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
8465,Michael,"Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning."
8466,Michael,"Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin'?"
8467,Michael,"Hey, congrats on the bonus."
8468,Michael,I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
8469,Pam,"Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?"
8470,Dwight,I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. 
8471,Ryan,Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
8472,Ryan,"Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?"
8473,Michael,Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
8474,Ryan,"Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott."
8475,Michael,"Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!"
8476,Michael,"Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery."
8477,Michael,"And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes."
8478,Ryan,Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
8479,Ryan,"You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?"
8480,Michael,"No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that."
8481,Michael,"My other boss, Mr. Figaro."
8482,Ryan,You have another job?
8483,Michael,What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
8484,Jim,Are you a cocktail waitress?
8485,Ryan,You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
8486,Ryan,"It did, all ready."
8487,Michael,"Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. "
8488,Ryan,Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
8489,Ryan,"It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need."
8490,Darryl,"There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this."
8491,Darryl,I have plans later.
8492,Ryan,How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
8493,Michael,"Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?"
8494,Ryan,"You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever."
8495,Michael,"It's whoever, not whomever."
8496,Michael,"No, whomever is never actually right."
8497,Jim,"No, sometimes its right."
8498,Andy,"No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word."
8499,Oscar,"Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly."
8500,Michael,Not a native speaker.
8501,Kevin,"I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night."
8502,Ryan,Do you really know which one is correct?
8503,Pam,"It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject."
8504,Michael,"Well it sounds right, but is it?"
8505,Pam,How did he use it again?
8506,Michael,"No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull."
8507,Ryan,"Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here."
8508,Michael,"I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history."
8509,Michael,"Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---"
8510,Michael,And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
8511,Michael,"In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this."
8512,Michael,"I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night."
8513,Andy,Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
8514,Andy,"Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves."
8515,Andy,I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
8516,Pam,I can't believe that's not working.
8517,Pam,"Um, I don't know if I really see you two together."
8518,Andy,"Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain."
8519,Andy,"Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses."
8520,Pam,"Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe."
8521,Andy,"Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall."
8522,Pam,"That's right, you did."
8523,Pam,"Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy."
8524,Michael,"Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses."
8525,Kevin,I do gamble Michael.
8526,Michael,"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?"
8527,Michael,Do you know anybody in the mob?
8528,Michael,"Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary."
8529,Darryl,I have my daughter tonight
8530,Kevin,"Yeah, women be shoppin'."
8531,Oscar,He's not even good at his first one.
8532,Michael,"What'cha talking about?  Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having s*x, what it looks like, I know, I think---"
8533,Oscar,"Michael, are you having money problems?"
8534,Michael,"Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?"
8535,Oscar,You heard me correctly.
8536,Michael,"Oh, I hate monkeys."
8537,Pam,"What's going on, why do you have a second job?"
8538,Michael,I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
8539,Pam,Doesn't Jan have money?
8540,Michael,"I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual."
8541,Kevin,"True, it's best to hide our money problems from women."
8542,Michael,"I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? "
8543,Michael,"Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore."
8544,Darryl,"Hey, let's call this what it is."
8545,Darryl,It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
8546,Darryl,"Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course."
8547,Darryl,"Slow down, think it over."
8548,Michael,"How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose."
8549,Michael,That is a good point.
8550,Michael,Like the witness protection program.
8551,Michael,"I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life."
8552,Oscar,"Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen."
8553,Michael,"I didn't say it, I declared it."
8554,Oscar,"Still, that's not anything."
8555,Oscar,This is a lot of credit card debt.
8556,Michael,"Yeah, tell me about it."
8557,Michael,"You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine."
8558,Oscar,"Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon."
8559,Michael,"Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic."
8560,Oscar,Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
8561,Michael,"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core."
8562,Andy,"I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game."
8563,Oscar,"Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house."
8564,Michael,Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
8565,Oscar,"The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that."
8566,Oscar,"This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment."
8567,Michael,How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
8568,Pam,"Man, Angela really had a hold on him.  Angela."
8569,Oscar,"Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy."
8570,Michael,"No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this."
8571,Oscar,She has to know.
8572,Michael,"We will find another way, we'll ask power-point."
8573,Oscar,"Michael, this is a presentation tool."
8574,Michael,You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
8575,Michael,"No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half."
8576,Jim,"Dwight, how's the hotel business?"
8577,Jim,Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
8578,Dwight,Maybe you should. Whatever.
8579,Pam,"We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times."
8580,Jim,The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
8581,Pam,Table making never seemed so possible.
8582,Jim,You will never want to leave your room.
8583,Pam,The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
8584,Dwight,I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
8585,Pam,We really did. It was fun.
8586,Oscar,"So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt."
8587,Michael,"Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?"
8588,Oscar,I don't think so.
8589,Michael,"What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good."
8590,Angela," You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood."
8591,Jim,Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
8592,Jim,"Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam."
8593,Jim,"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you."
8594,Pam,"Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- "
8595,Jim,"Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be."
8596,Pam,Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
8597,Jim,"Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food."
8598,Oscar,"Jan, he went running that way."
8599,Michael," Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back."
8600,Michael,"Not much, what's up with you?"
8601,Michael,I'm out of answers Jan.
8602,Michael,"I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you."
8603,Michael,I don't know that.
8604,Michael,I'll stay off the grid.
8605,Michael,"Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up."
8606,Michael,That's really nice of you to say.
8607,Michael,I think the engineer left.
8608,Dwight," Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now."
8609,Michael,Don't sell your implants please.
8610,Michael,It looks cute though.
8611,Michael,"Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!"
8612,Michael,Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
8613,Michael,"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby."
8614,Andy,"Best ad ever.  Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?"
8615,Jim,"You got it, you're so close!"
8616,Andy, Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
8617,Jim,"Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think..."
8618,Andy,Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
8619,Michael,"Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?"
8620,Pam,I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
8621,Michael,"Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good."
8622,Michael,Excited to talk ideas.
8623,Michael,"You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing."
8624,Michael,"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with."
8625,Michael,I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
8626,Michael,He gives the best back rubs in the office.
8627,Andy,"It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!"
8628,Michael,Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
8629,Michael,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
8630,Michael,"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun."
8631,Jim,"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide."
8632,Jim,You playing that game again?
8633,Dwight,"Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers."
8634,Jim,Oh it has losers.
8635,Dwight,I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. 
8636,Michael," Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further---"
8637,Michael,"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so..."
8638,Michael,That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.
8639,Michael,Well we can do better than that.
8640,Andy,"I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?"
8641,Dwight,"We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us."
8642,Andy,We'll use code names.
8643,Dwight,"Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight."
8644,Andy,That's not different enough.
8645,Michael," Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek!  I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry."
8646,Michael,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem."
8647,Ryan,I told you not to call about small problems.
8648,Michael,"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas."
8649,Ryan,"That's good. They're creative, you're not."
8650,Ryan,"It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant."
8651,Michael,"Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store."
8652,Ryan,"Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?"
8653,Ryan,But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
8654,Michael,"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity."
8655,Michael,"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet."
8656,Michael,"Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today."
8657,Michael,"How about never hundred hours, sir."
8658,Michael,Hey thanks. Thank you.
8659,Michael,"Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again."
8660,Michael,"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime."
8661,Michael,I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
8662,Michael,"Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way."
8663,Michael,"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, ""You're not creative""?"
8664,Michael,"Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with."
8665,Jim,"Who are you talking to, specifically?"
8666,Kevin,I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. 
8667,Oscar,When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
8668,Michael,"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area."
8669,Michael,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer."
8670,Andy,"Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?"
8671,Andy,Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
8672,Angela,I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
8673,Michael,Line it up Phyllis.
8674,Darryl," Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain."
8675,Michael,"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap."
8676,Michael,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix."
8677,Andy,News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
8678,Pam,"No talk, I'm animating."
8679,Jim,"Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here.  Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality."
8680,Pam,"Oh my God, he's really in pain."
8681,Jim,"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever."
8682,Pam,He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
8683,Jim,"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---"
8684,Pam,Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
8685,Pam,You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
8686,Jim,I... why don't we go back to this animation.
8687,Pam,"No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim."
8688,Jim,"Ah, show me how this works."
8689,Darryl," Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin."
8690,Michael,Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
8691,Darryl,"You're right, it's better than you! It's us!  Dunder Mifflin."
8692,Michael,"No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible."
8693,Darryl,"You're on your own, Mike. "
8694,Michael,"Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl."
8695,Darryl,You just said you hated it.
8696,Michael,"No. I said I hate the, the style."
8697,Andy, Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
8698,Michael,"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible."
8699,Andy,Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
8700,Michael,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?"
8701,Michael,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?"
8702,Michael,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? "
8703,Jim,"I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one."
8704,Pam,"Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet."
8705,Jim,Okay. Do you want me to stay?
8706,Pam,"No no, you can go home. I'm good."
8707,Jim,"Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home."
8708,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
8709,Jim,"Good morning.  Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns."
8710,Pam,"I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide."
8711,Andy,Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
8712,Dwight,"Andy, I can't hear this right now."
8713,Andy,"No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, ""Oh D, oh D."""
8714,Dwight,She called you D?
8715,Andy,Yeah. D for Andy.
8716,Michael,I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. 
8717,Michael,"Pam, please clear my phone lines."
8718,Michael,They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call.
8719,Michael," Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!"
8720,Michael,"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real."
8721,Jim,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?"
8722,Jim,"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it."
8723,Jim,Animation? All her by the way. 
8724,Jim,I just thought you should---
8725,Kevin,"Michael, that was fun."
8726,Michael,"That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!"
8727,Andy," Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet.  It's gotta rhyme with ""piece."" Fancy Feast!  Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it."
8728,Dwight,He looks like your twin.
8729,Michael,"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone."
8730,Michael,"But, you will not tell anyone."
8731,Dwight,I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.
8732,Michael,"Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?"
8733,Michael,"Just go out, and come back in."
8734,Michael,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there."
8735,Michael,"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her."
8736,Jim,"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening."
8737,Michael,"Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?"
8738,Michael,That could not possibly be it.
8739,Michael,"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming."
8740,Michael,How can I get you to stay?
8741,Michael,"Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving."
8742,Michael,"Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-"
8743,Pam,"Oscar, did you bring it?"
8744,Oscar,To be Edwardian. His best work.
8745,Pam,"Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware."
8746,Oscar,"Sure thing Pam, can't wait."
8747,Pam,"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive."
8748,Oscar,"Besides having s*x with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me."
8749,Jim,So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
8750,Pam,Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
8751,Michael,"Fillipellers, how's it hanging?"
8752,Michael,"Okay, enough small talk, go ahead."
8753,Michael,"Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this."
8754,Michael,"No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby."
8755,Michael,"You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours."
8756,Michael,"Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one? "
8757,Pam,"I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica."
8758,Michael,"Hi Ben, Michael Scott."
8759,Michael,"I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend."
8760,Michael," Get out.  Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby."
8761,Michael,"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?"
8762,Michael,"What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House."
8763,Michael,"Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it."
8764,Jim,So what are you going to do?
8765,Michael,"What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples."
8766,Michael,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?"
8767,Pam,"It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things."
8768,Michael,"That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright?  Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words."
8769,Jim,We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
8770,Michael,What? What? We did?
8771,Michael,Look at his face! Look at his face!
8772,Jim,What are we doing?
8773,Dwight,"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah."
8774,Michael,"What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?"
8775,Dwight,"Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today."
8776,Michael,"We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing."
8777,Jim,We're going to Utica?
8778,Jim,I'm not going to Utica right now.
8779,Michael,"Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim."
8780,Michael,We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
8781,Jim,I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
8782,Michael,Are you calling Karen?
8783,Jim,"No, I'm not calling Karen."
8784,Jim,"What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!"
8785,Jim,Are you kidding me?
8786,Dwight,No communication with the outside world Jim.
8787,Michael,"It had to be done, it had to be done."
8788,Jim,"Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so..."
8789,Dwight,"Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot."
8790,Michael,"Hey Dwight, he found it."
8791,Jim,You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.
8792,Michael,"Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever."
8793,Jim,"Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?"
8794,Michael,Do you really wanna know?
8795,Michael,"Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs."
8796,Michael,"No, no, not real bombs."
8797,Dwight,"Yeah, come on, it will be so badass."
8798,Michael,"Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know."
8799,Michael,"It could be badass. Yeah, it will."
8800,Jim,"No, no absolutely we are not doing this."
8801,Dwight,"Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass."
8802,Jim,Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
8803,Michael,Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
8804,Jim,"So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache."
8805,Michael,"So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the s*x?"
8806,Michael,"I can't imagine the s*x being bad, I mean her body is..."
8807,Jim,"Okay, you know what?"
8808,Jim,Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
8809,Michael,"Okay, I will start. Um, ""A.""  ""A"" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um..."
8810,Michael,I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
8811,Michael,"Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something?"
8812,Jim,"That doesn't make sense, couldn't be."
8813,Michael,"What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?"
8814,Dwight,I'm peeing in this empty can.
8815,Michael,"Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!"
8816,Dwight,"Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go."
8817,Jim,"Michael, watch the road!"
8818,Dwight,"Hey, you're making me spray!"
8819,Michael,I'll kill you man!
8820,Jim,"Michael! Michael, pull over!"
8821,Michael,That is just so disgusting!
8822,Jim,"Pull over, pull over!"
8823,Dwight,I think I cut my pen1s on the lid!
8824,Oscar,Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
8825,Pam,"And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?"
8826,Andy," Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit."
8827,Oscar,What are you doing?
8828,Andy,"Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam."
8829,Pam,"Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club."
8830,Andy,"The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety."
8831,Andy,"Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading."
8832,Andy,Why can't I be in the club?
8833,Jim,"I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening."
8834,Michael,"Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?"
8835,Jim,"No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car."
8836,Michael,"Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-"
8837,Jim,Guy's going by. Shh.
8838,Michael,You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
8839,Dwight,"And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk."
8840,Jim,"No, no, you won't do that. Nope."
8841,Dwight,Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
8842,Jim,"Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?"
8843,Jim,"Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go."
8844,Dwight,"Let's move! Move, move, move, move!"
8845,Jim,"Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done."
8846,Pam,"I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion.  And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention."
8847,Pam,"It just-  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh..."
8848,Pam,Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
8849,Pam,"Very brave choice also, I thought."
8850,Oscar,"And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom.  Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um... What are you microwaving!?"
8851,Pam,"Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?"
8852,Andy,"So, Stanley, are you really outta here?"
8853,Andy,"I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch."
8854,Michael, We are in a stairwell.
8855,Dwight, We are climbing some stairs.
8856,Jim,"Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me."
8857,Michael,"There's a guy, there's a guy."
8858,Dwight,"There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?"
8859,Michael,"Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close."
8860,Dwight,I can see the security guard's eyes.
8861,Jim,"No, no, don't do anything to them."
8862,Dwight,I have to do something to his eyes.
8863,Dwight,The eyes are the groin of the head.
8864,Jim,"Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home."
8865,Michael,"We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier."
8866,Jim,Isn't that thing huge?
8867,Michael,"It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running."
8868,Jim,"No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this."
8869,Michael,"We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us."
8870,Dwight,"Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!"
8871,Jim,"Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-"
8872,Michael,"Dwight, you gotta move!"
8873,Michael,"Dwight, could you move over a little bit."
8874,Dwight,I'm losing control of my bladder.
8875,Jim,"Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!"
8876,Dwight,Did you say Karen?
8877,Michael,"Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim."
8878,Jim,"No, I'm not doing that."
8879,Michael,Just say you wanna get back together.
8880,Jim,"No, I'm not doing that!"
8881,Michael,"It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies."
8882,Jim,"First of all, hi."
8883,Jim,"You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so..."
8884,Dwight,Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
8885,Dwight,"Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people."
8886,Dwight,Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
8887,Michael," Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. "
8888,Jim,"Yeah, trying to quit though."
8889,Jim,"Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you..."
8890,Jim,"I mean, it's just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you..."
8891,Jim," Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic."
8892,Michael,"We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad."
8893,Michael,"Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart.  I can't do this."
8894,Pam,"I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility."
8895,Jim,Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
8896,Jim," Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I."
8897,Oscar,"Okay, did you get it out of your system."
8898,Jim,"Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read."
8899,Jim,"No, that wasn't fun."
8900,Jim,Of course I read it.
8901,Oscar,How does it end?
8902,Jim,Angela. Nope. The ashes.
8903,Pam,"Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a ""get to know you"" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him."
8904,Pam,Did you sleep in cabins?
8905,Michael," Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up."
8906,Michael,"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?  Not real."
8907,Michael,"So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?"
8908,Jim,"When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes."
8909,Michael,"Oh, you wanna go today?"
8910,Jim,And I am always busy.
8911,Jim,"Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood."
8912,Michael,How often can you actually donate blood?
8913,Jim,Is there a limit?
8914,Michael,Your body only has a certain amount.
8915,Jim,"Well, is that it? Or?"
8916,Michael,"Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame."
8917,Michael,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? "
8918,Michael,"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---"
8919,Michael,"In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change."
8920,Michael,"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos."
8921,Jim,I thought we had that looked at.
8922,Michael,I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
8923,Michael,"When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called ""Survivorman."" And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed."
8924,Michael,"OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife."
8925,Michael,"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what..."
8926,Dwight,Let's see if any of these will work. 
8927,Michael,"Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight."
8928,Dwight,"I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, ""Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place."" Well I say, ""It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."""
8929,Michael,"Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day."
8930,Pam,Do you want me to ask where you're going?
8931,Michael,Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
8932,Michael,Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
8933,Jim,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?"
8934,Michael,"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me."
8935,Michael,"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I."
8936,Michael,"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being."
8937,Dwight,"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not."
8938,Michael,"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead."
8939,Dwight,"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape."
8940,Michael,"Well, yes I would. And I would survive."
8941,Dwight,I would make sure that you were dead.
8942,Dwight,"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified."
8943,Dwight,And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
8944,Michael,You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.
8945,Dwight,What are you doing?
8946,Michael,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been---  Ow! What are you doing?"
8947,Dwight,It would be better if you were unconscious.
8948,Michael,"No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it."
8949,Dwight,Do you want to do this right or not?
8950,Michael,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?"
8951,Angela,"Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday."
8952,Jim,"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?"
8953,Angela,"Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?"
8954,Jim,"I do remember, yeah."
8955,Angela,It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month.  Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
8956,Jim,"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?"
8957,Jim,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are."
8958,Michael, Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
8959,Jim,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to ""Happy Birthday."" And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault."
8960,Jim,"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive."
8961,Jim,"We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time."
8962,Angela,I don't like it. 
8963,Pam,"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?"
8964,Jim,"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?"
8965,Pam,Do you think it's a good idea?
8966,Jim,No... I think it's a great idea.
8967,Michael,Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
8968,Dwight, Here we go. Just the two of us 
8969,Dwight,"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?"
8970,Dwight,"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets  Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it."
8971,Jim,"You know, try sending them another invoice."
8972,Jim,"Alright.  Oh, did you see my memo by the way?"
8973,Oscar," ""Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today."" This is really cool."
8974,Jim,Right? I was just thinking...
8975,Oscar,"No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun."
8976,Jim,Right! Exactly.  Knew I could count on you. 
8977,Dwight,Good a spot as any. 
8978,Michael,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --"
8979,Dwight,Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction.  Behold.
8980,Michael,"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight."
8981,Dwight,Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
8982,Michael,"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. "
8983,Michael,"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. "
8984,Pam,Wow! That was easy.
8985,Jim,"Yeah, people like me I guess."
8986,Jim,Well I think Meredith was just --
8987,Jim,What do you want?
8988,Jim,You want a birthday pie?
8989,Jim,"Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie."
8990,Jim,It will be Angela.
8991,Michael," Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.  OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here..."
8992,Dwight,"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity."
8993,Michael,"There we go.  Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts ."
8994,Michael,I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. 
8995,Michael,"See, this is a beautiful piece of material  This could be used for all sorts of things."
8996,Michael,Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
8997,Andy,"Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale."
8998,Andy,"Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale."
8999,Jim,"Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no."
9000,Andy,"Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up."
9001,Jim,"Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make."
9002,Jim,"OK, I'm gonna go into this office here  to do some work. So I will be in here."
9003,Michael,"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me.  Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter."
9004,Dwight,Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here.  I hope he finds it.  Lunch.
9005,Michael,"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious."
9006,Dwight,About two more minutes .
9007,Michael,"I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday.  Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy."
9008,Kevin,"Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break."
9009,Oscar,Why don't you just have an apple?
9010,Oscar,Probably went to his head.
9011,Jim,"Hey guys, what're we talking about?"
9012,Michael,"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy  may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day."
9013,Dwight,Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is...  on.
9014,Jim,Is there anything --
9015,Jim,"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much.  I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon."
9016,Jim,"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?"
9017,Angela,"No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps."
9018,Jim,"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing."
9019,Jim,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing?  One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it."
9020,Angela,What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
9021,Kevin,"Oh, I'll take 'em."
9022,Jim,"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact."
9023,Michael,"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those  are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. "
9024,Dwight,"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo!  Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. "
9025,Michael,"Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something."
9026,Michael,"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out.  I can also make it the sky."
9027,Jim,Sure glad you're back.
9028,Jim,You have no idea.
9029,Michael,So what did I miss?
9030,Jim,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once."
9031,Michael,"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake."
9032,Jim,You did do it?
9033,Michael,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out."
9034,Jim,"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years."
9035,Michael,That's what I said. That's what she said.
9036,Jim,That's what who said?
9037,Michael,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard."
9038,Jim,That's what she said.
9039,Michael,"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward."
9040,Oscar,"So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- "
9041,Kevin,You never call back.
9042,Pam,"Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes."
9043,Michael," Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back."
9044,Michael,You can't always work 200 days though.
9045,Michael," Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. "
9046,Ryan,You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
9047,Ryan,I can get you a tutor if you need- 
9048,Michael,"Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later."
9049,Ryan,"Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call."
9050,Michael,"N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude."
9051,Ryan,"Take the call, friend."
9052,Michael,"I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist."
9053,Ryan,I insist you take your work calls.
9054,Michael,"Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy."
9055,Michael,"Yeah, I hate that."
9056,Michael,"So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs."
9057,Michael,"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy."
9058,Michael,Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
9059,Michael,Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
9060,Michael,"Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized."
9061,Michael,"Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good."
9062,Michael,"I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up."
9063,Michael,"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?"
9064,Michael,"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is."
9065,Ryan,I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
9066,Ryan,Could we talk off the record? As friends?
9067,Michael,I would love that.
9068,Ryan,"Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?"
9069,Michael,Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
9070,Ryan,Good. That is great to hear.
9071,Jim,"All right, let's run it back."
9072,Pam,The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
9073,Pam,I don't wanna guess.
9074,Pam,Jim. Can I see you for a second?
9075,Pam,"Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl."
9076,Jim,"Oh, I can't beat Darryl."
9077,Pam,Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
9078,Jim,"What, seriously? What is she saying?"
9079,Jim,So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
9080,Michael,"Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?"
9081,Michael,"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?"
9082,Michael,Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
9083,Michael,"Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior."
9084,Pam,"Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you."
9085,Pam,He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
9086,Kevin,Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
9087,Pam,"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room."
9088,Michael,"I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief"
9089,Michael,Six years and two months.
9090,Michael,That's what she said.
9091,Michael,That's what she said.
9092,Michael,"Uh, wh-why would she say that?"
9093,Michael,Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
9094,Michael,"Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it."
9095,Michael,She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
9096,Michael,"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk."
9097,Michael,"Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant."
9098,Michael,"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules."
9099,Michael,"Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. "
9100,Michael,I will allow it.
9101,Michael,"Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define ""begin"". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago."
9102,Michael,"If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that."
9103,Dwight,All right! What is going on here?
9104,Jim,"Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?"
9105,Dwight,"All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, Jörg Roßkopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba."
9106,Michael,"Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition."
9107,Michael,Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
9108,Michael,I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
9109,Michael, Can I sit here?
9110,Michael,How can you give up my diary like that?
9111,Michael,How'd you even find it?
9112,Michael,I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
9113,Michael,Fine. I love you.
9114,Michael,"Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend."
9115,Michael,"Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had s*x with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful."
9116,Michael,Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
9117,Michael,"That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water."
9118,Michael," ""I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."""
9119,Dwight,"Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable."
9120,Jim,"Check this out though, spin serve.  Well, it works like 80% of the time, so..."
9121,Pam,"Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?"
9122,Jim,I think I'm ready.
9123,Pam,I'll make the call.
9124,Dwight,"Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass."
9125,Michael,How can you do that to me?
9126,Michael,"Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it."
9127,Michael,See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
9128,Pam, Yes! Way to go.  See that?
9129,Pam,"You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!"
9130,Pam,Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
9131,Jim,Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
9132,Michael,"Oh, hey no biggie. Just..."
9133,Michael,I think you're a nice guy too.
9134,Michael,"Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend."
9135,Michael, What do you want to do for dinner?
9136,Michael,Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
9137,Michael,Do you fast food?
9138,Michael,"Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?"
9139,Jim,"Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working."
9140,Michael,"Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday."
9141,Michael,"All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there."
9142,Jim,I think you did.
9143,Michael,"I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?"
9144,Michael,You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
9145,Jim,"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate."
9146,Dwight,"Michael, what time should I be arriving?"
9147,Michael,"Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy."
9148,Dwight,Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? 
9149,Michael,Come on in. Good to see you.
9150,Michael,"Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?"
9151,Jim,"Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?"
9152,Jim,I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
9153,Michael,Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
9154,Pam,We got you this. 
9155,Michael,"Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa."
9156,Jim,"Tour, let's do the tour first."
9157,Michael,Totally your call babe.
9158,Jim,"Oh, you guys doing a little construction?"
9159,Michael,"Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door."
9160,Michael,"Yep, never been used."
9161,Michael,"This is it, check that out, can you smell that? "
9162,Michael,As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
9163,Pam,So you have an office and a workspace?
9164,Michael,"James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. "
9165,Michael,"Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color."
9166,Pam,What a cute bench.
9167,Michael,"Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy."
9168,Jim,Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
9169,Michael,It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. 
9170,Michael,"I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall."
9171,Michael,"Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table."
9172,Jim,What is that chestnut?
9173,Michael,"No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry."
9174,Jim,"Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool."
9175,Pam,"Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week."
9176,Michael,"If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away."
9177,Jim,"Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see."
9178,Michael,"Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies."
9179,Andy,"Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner?  I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna!  These are for you. "
9180,Andy,"Except for one flower, which is for... my flower."
9181,Angela,What am I supposed to do with this?
9182,Pam,Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
9183,Pam,Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
9184,Michael,Whatever you say babe.
9185,Michael,How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
9186,Michael,Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
9187,Michael,Yeah that sounds good.
9188,Michael,"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him."
9189,Angela,Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
9190,Pam," I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party."
9191,Andy, No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
9192,Andy,"Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital."
9193,Pam,Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
9194,Michael,"All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn."
9195,Michael,"Yes, I was watching Jim's face."
9196,Michael,And he was laughing.
9197,Michael,"Look at him, he's laughing."
9198,Jim,Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. 
9199,Jim,"You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage."
9200,Michael,Well you don't need two of you to do that.
9201,Jim,"That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much."
9202,Pam,"Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself."
9203,Jim,I don't know because I everything I own is there.
9204,Pam,You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
9205,Michael,"That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right."
9206,Michael,"All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-"
9207,Michael,"All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE."
9208,Michael,"No, Baah! But he's married to her!"
9209,Michael,"No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger."
9210,Jim,Not really a rhyme.
9211,Angela,"Another clue, another clue."
9212,Michael,"Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator."
9213,Michael,"God, does anybody read the paper?!"
9214,Michael,I don't like that story babe.
9215,Michael,"Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible."
9216,Michael,"Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!"
9217,Angela,You shouldn't joke about that.
9218,Pam,Is there more wine in the kitchen?
9219,Angela,So you keep a very tidy house.
9220,Pam,"Oh, are you joking?"
9221,Pam,"I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever."
9222,Angela,I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
9223,Michael, So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
9224,Jim,Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
9225,Michael,"Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of ""Serenity by Jan"" What do you think about that?"
9226,Andy,"Thought about it, I'm in."
9227,Jim,"I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?"
9228,Michael,I'm sorry.  What now?
9229,Dwight,"We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?"
9230,Angela,"Yes, What are you doing here?"
9231,Michael,Dwight is my friend.
9232,Michael,"You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person."
9233,Michael,"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?"
9234,Michael,"When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children."
9235,Michael,Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? 
9236,Dwight,So can we come in?
9237,Dwight,Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
9238,Dwight,"Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?"
9239,Angela,I hate beet salad.
9240,Dwight,Hey hey hey hey.  I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
9241,Angela,The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
9242,Michael, Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
9243,Michael,"I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe."
9244,Pam,I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
9245,Michael,"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?"
9246,Michael,Excuse me for a second. 
9247,Jim, So... how do you guys know each other?
9248,Pam,And now you guys are dating?
9249,Dwight,Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
9250,Jim,Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
9251,Michael,Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
9252,Michael,Everybody enjoying their meal?
9253,Michael,No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
9254,Michael, Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
9255,Michael,BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
9256,Michael,NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
9257,Michael,MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
9258,Michael,OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
9259,Michael," THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! "
9260,Dwight,Fine. Get outta here.
9261,Michael,"You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon."
9262,Dwight,"Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?"
9263,Michael,Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
9264,Michael,Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
9265,Michael,Would she get into trouble?
9266,Michael,I will take the fall. I did it.
9267,Dwight, Michael can come home with me.
9268,Jim,Oh... my apartment's on fire
9269,Dwight,You people.  Come on. You're sleeping with me.
9270,Dwight,I'm gonna take you home Michael.
9271,Pam," This is the best burger I've ever had, babe."
9272,Jim,"You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad."
9273,Jim, I stole this.  For you babe.
9274,Pam,W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
9275,Jim,So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
9276,Pam,Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
9277,Jim,"Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken."
9278,Oscar,Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
9279,Andy,"I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar."
9280,Kevin," I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed."
9281,Pam,Some of us like the walk more than others.
9282,Pam, Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
9283,Michael,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair."
9284,Pam,"But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair."
9285,Pam,"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these.  I really want it."
9286,Michael, Have you ever seen this woman?
9287,Pam,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
9288,Michael,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch."
9289,Pam,Or in a great chair.
9290,Michael,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?"
9291,Pam,I definitely remember your dinner party.
9292,Michael,I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman.  Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
9293,Pam,"Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair."
9294,Michael,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
9295,Michael,"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. "
9296,Pam," No, he hasn't picked one yet."
9297,Michael,"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all."
9298,Andy,I left my cell phone in my car.
9299,Michael," Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?"
9300,Kevin,"If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself."
9301,Michael,I thought that you were engaged?
9302,Kevin,Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
9303,Michael,"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?"
9304,Kevin,It's a bitter situation.
9305,Michael,Yeah... ugh. She's...  you don't deserve her. Alright.
9306,Michael," Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm..."
9307,Michael,"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?"
9308,Michael,Oooo. Catcher or in field?
9309,Michael,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?"
9310,Michael,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
9311,Michael,"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!"
9312,Michael,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
9313,Michael,"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes."
9314,Angela,I don't think that this is---
9315,Michael,"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear ""Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la."" No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired."
9316,Andy,"Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot."
9317,Andy,It's like a ten minute walk.
9318,Michael,"Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad."
9319,Michael,That would be bad.
9320,Andy,...So help us out.
9321,Michael,"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't."
9322,Michael,"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves."
9323,Andy,We won't let you down.
9324,Michael,"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen,  don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards."
9325,Pam, Who are you putting down?
9326,Jim,"Oh, you don't know her."
9327,Pam,"Yeah, whatever.   Give it to me. Give it to me."
9328,Michael,"Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. "
9329,Michael,"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael."
9330,Michael,"Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?"
9331,Michael," Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?"
9332,Michael,"Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready."
9333,Michael,Well put it aside.   Umm... yeah.
9334,Dwight,"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies."
9335,Michael,Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
9336,Dwight,"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit."
9337,Michael,"That sounds good.  Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go."
9338,Dwight," That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed."
9339,Dwight,"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information.  Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed."
9340,Michael,She's dead?  She's so young.
9341,Dwight,She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
9342,Dwight,Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on.  Here we go. Yeah.
9343,Jim,"Michael, you didn't even know her."
9344,Michael,Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
9345,Dwight,"Jim, how dare you. "
9346,Michael,"Please, not at a time like this. "
9347,Pam,"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you."
9348,Michael,Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
9349,Pam,"No, I mean it.  She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. "
9350,Michael,"I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?"
9351,Pam,"I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this."
9352,Michael,"No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again."
9353,Kevin,We need to assemble the five families.
9354,Michael," No, not the five families."
9355,Kevin,"The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him ""Cool Guy Paul."" W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean."
9356,Michael," Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now."
9357,Kevin, I'm calling the meeting anyway.
9358,Michael," Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. "
9359,Michael,Is who a Michael what?
9360,Michael,"Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK..."
9361,Michael,So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
9362,Michael,"Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?"
9363,Michael,You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that.
9364,Michael,"Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know."
9365,Michael,"Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus."
9366,Michael,Now you ruined it. 
9367,Andy,Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
9368,Andy,"Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone."
9369,Andy,"Well first of all, I'd just like to say  what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen."
9370,Kevin,We want our parking spaces back!
9371,Kevin,W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
9372,Kevin,"After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see...  It's just nice to win one."
9373,Michael,"Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?"
9374,Pam,She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
9375,Michael,"Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God..."
9376,Jim,You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. 
9377,Pam,"Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move."
9378,Jim,"Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud."
9379,Pam,"Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too."
9380,Jim,"OK, sure. Let's do it. "
9381,Pam,"No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged."
9382,Jim,"Have I not proposed to you, yet?"
9383,Pam,"Hmm, I don't, know..."
9384,Jim,"Oh, well, that's coming. "
9385,Jim,"No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame."
9386,Pam,"OK, so then, when?"
9387,Jim,"Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works."
9388,Jim,"Wait, I'm serious. It's happening."
9389,Jim,"And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp."
9390,Jim,I am not kidding.  Got it a week after we started dating.
9391,Michael,I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... 
9392,Dwight,You know what you need? Closure.
9393,Michael,You're right. What do you mean though?
9394,Dwight,"There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye."
9395,Dwight,Come on. I'll drive.
9396,Kevin,We got our spaces back.
9397,Andy,"Yeah, there it is. You're welcome."
9398,Andy,"Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park."
9399,Michael, How did she die?
9400,Dwight,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
9401,Michael,She was so innocent.
9402,Dwight,She was stoned apparently.
9403,Michael,"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?"
9404,Dwight,You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
9405,Michael,"Oh, you move on."
9406,Jim,Where do you want to go for dinner?
9407,Pam,"I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one..."
9408,Jim,"Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?"
9409,Jim,"What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem?  Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh."
9410,Pam,How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
9411,Michael," Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off  and die?"
9412,Michael,This'll be  the day that I died.
9413,Michael,I got gum in my hair.
9414,Michael,"This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it."
9415,Dwight,You've got a ton of dandruff.
9416,Michael,"OK, let me be."
9417,Jim,How'd you get gum in your hair?
9418,Michael,"I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil."
9419,Jim,"But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter."
9420,Michael,Kill me... right now.
9421,Pam,We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
9422,Michael,I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
9423,Jim,"Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am."
9424,Pam,"No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad."
9425,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about."
9426,Michael,Oh don't. That's disgusting.
9427,Dwight,Wow! Lot of calories.
9428,Michael,"Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice."
9429,Dwight,"Hey Michael, how was your date last night?"
9430,Michael,"I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness."
9431,Oscar,"I am livid, Absolutely livid."
9432,Ryan,"Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working."
9433,Ryan,My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
9434,Jim,"Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?"
9435,Jim,"Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that."
9436,Ryan,"I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that."
9437,Ryan,"David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?"
9438,Jim,Did I? I don't...
9439,Ryan,Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
9440,Michael,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or..."
9441,Ryan,I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
9442,Dwight,Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
9443,Ryan,This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
9444,Ryan,"I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O."
9445,Ryan,"Yes, yes they did, yes they did."
9446,Ryan,"Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators."
9447,Dwight,I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
9448,Jim,"Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one."
9449,Ryan,"It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store."
9450,Jim,"And then an older gentleman asked you ""Boxers or briefs?"""
9451,Ryan,Do you have a question Kelly?
9452,Michael," Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good."
9453,Michael,Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
9454,Michael,"Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. "
9455,Ryan,Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
9456,Michael,Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
9457,Ryan,"But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city."
9458,Ryan,"Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace."
9459,Michael,Would you have s*x with Meredith?
9460,Michael,Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
9461,Jim,I'm gonna go to my desk.
9462,Michael,"Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that..."
9463,Michael,Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
9464,Michael,"Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome."
9465,Michael,That's still going on?
9466,Michael,"Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls."
9467,Andy,Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
9468,Dwight,"No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three."
9469,Michael,"Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift."
9470,Michael,I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
9471,Michael,"That's... I, I think that..."
9472,Jim,"You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow."
9473,Jim,"So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one."
9474,Michael,Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
9475,Michael,"Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall."
9476,Dwight,Women look like white slaves.
9477,Michael,"No, they're just hotties."
9478,Ryan,"I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour."
9479,Ryan,What are you doing here?
9480,Michael,"Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada."
9481,Ryan,That is so awesome man!
9482,Ryan,And you brought this guy!
9483,Michael,"Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight."
9484,Ryan,I know it's you guys.
9485,Ryan,I'm so psyched you're here!
9486,Ryan,Let's get a drink.
9487,Jim,"Thanks a lot guys, Good job."
9488,Jim,Nice job everybody. Great work.
9489,Jim,"Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now."
9490,Pam,"You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left."
9491,Pam,"There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, ""What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?"" He said, ""If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks."""
9492,Ryan,"Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy."
9493,Michael,"Hey, nice to meet you."
9494,Dwight,"Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character."
9495,Ryan,"Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard."
9496,Dwight,"No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit."
9497,Michael,"Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour."
9498,Michael,"Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries."
9499,Dwight,Do you live in a regular sized house?
9500,Ryan,"Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool."
9501,Jim,You really don't have his phone number?
9502,Pam,"I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?"
9503,Pam,Aw! That's great Toby.
9504,Pam,"Toby, you're the best."
9505,Jim,"Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or..."
9506,Jim,It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
9507,Jim,"It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or..."
9508,Jim,"No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?"
9509,Jim,"Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?"
9510,Ryan,Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
9511,Ryan,This guy owns his own beet farm.
9512,Dwight,Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
9513,Ryan,"Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?"
9514,Dwight,"They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out."
9515,Ryan,"Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom."
9516,Dwight,You've already been several times.
9517,Dwight,Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
9518,Ryan,"I don't know, maybe."
9519,Dwight,I'll order you some cranberry juice.
9520,Ryan,"With vodka, you're the best."
9521,Dwight, Do you have powers?
9522,Jim," Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it.  Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out.  He said it should just be under an hour, so...  we did it."
9523,Oscar,We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
9524,Angela,"Yeah, neither did I."
9525,Kevin,"Way to go, man."
9526,Andy,"By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? "
9527,Michael,"I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting ""Back to the Future."" ""Back"" because it's on my back and ""Future"" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie."
9528,Michael,"Back to the Future?  Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course."
9529,Michael,Forty... I'm in my forties.
9530,Michael,This place is like sexy pre-school.
9531,Ryan,Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
9532,Ryan,Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. 
9533,Michael,"Ahh, wow. That's dangerous."
9534,Ryan," Check again, Ryan Howard."
9535,Dwight, How did you all find each other?
9536,Ryan, It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
9537,Dwight,"Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.  You two, Jersey State girls, let's go."
9538,Dwight,"OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him . Let's go, c'mon. Here we go."
9539,Pam,I know how to throw a football.
9540,Andy,"Yeah, Pam! Hit me up! Go long. Woo! "
9541,Dwight,"Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?"
9542,Dwight,It's not safe. Anything could have been in there.  Nice try.
9543,Michael,I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
9544,Michael,I am a bank teller.
9545,Michael,Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
9546,Michael,"Yeah, I have fun."
9547,Michael,Very perfect.  Oh my  This needs to be shared.  
9548,Ryan,You're doing it man.
9549,Michael,"I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom."
9550,Ryan,"Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?"
9551,Jim," Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up."
9552,Jim,Haaank. Is that you?
9553,Jim,"Still haven't left the house yet, huh?"
9554,Jim,Will do.  I'll stop calling.
9555,Michael," I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not...  Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls."
9556,Pam,"Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow."
9557,Pam,"I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. "
9558,Michael, Those girls really wailed on you bad.
9559,Ryan,Why wouldn't they let me dance?
9560,Dwight,"I do, I have to go."
9561,Dwight,"No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?"
9562,Dwight,Uh huh.  I'm not gonna call her.
9563,Ryan,I don't wanna go back in.
9564,Michael,"I know, here we go."
9565,Jim," Cleaning people. Oscar.  OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us."
9566,Oscar,Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
9567,Jim,I... just... if they speak Spanish.
9568,Oscar," Good evening, we locked ourselves in.  Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?"
9569,Ryan,"This is a one time thing, you know that right? "
9570,Michael,This is where the magic happens.
9571,Ryan,"One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have..."
9572,Dwight,I got sofa. I got sofa.
9573,Michael,"Dwight, I'm the boss."
9574,Michael,"Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on."
9575,Dwight," Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?"
9576,Michael,"Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone."
9577,Michael,"Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off."
9578,Ryan,"No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?"
9579,Dwight,I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
9580,Michael,"Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it."
9581,Ryan,"Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?"
9582,Dwight,OK. Good night Ryan.
9583,Michael,"Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys."
9584,Michael,"Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!"
9585,Pam,Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
9586,Michael,"Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?"
9587,Kevin,Michael you could put your initials in it.
9588,Michael,M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
9589,Michael,"Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!"
9590,Michael,"Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!"
9591,Michael,"It's drying, it's drying..."
9592,Michael,"Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!"
9593,Andy,"Here it is, you should draw a picture..."
9594,Andy,"Cause that says, that says..."
9595,Andy,So much more than words...
9596,Michael,"No!! Come on, gimme something good!"
9597,Pam,She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
9598,Jim,If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
9599,Michael,I love it more!
9600,Oscar,Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
9601,Michael,"I... love it!! Haha, come on!"
9602,Jim,"We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man."
9603,Jim,"Greatness is only skin deep, some people say..."
9604,Jim,Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
9605,Jim,And in this case...
9606,Jim,That's also not true.
9607,Dwight,And... go.  Force it in as deep as you can.
9608,Michael, That's what she said.
9609,Michael,"Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, ""That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..."" I dunno, it's a good feeling."
9610,Angela,"Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice."
9611,Andy,"Good one. Okay, you ready?"
9612,Andy," The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. ""Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?"""
9613,Angela, It's a man eating cat food.
9614,Andy,What about a cat eating man food?
9615,Dwight,Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
9616,Pam," Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up."
9617,Michael,"All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction..."
9618,Pam,I don't have my contacts...
9619,Michael,"Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room."
9620,Jim,"You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly..."
9621,Pam,"If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no."
9622,Jim,"Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world."
9623,Michael,"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?"
9624,Andy,"What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?"
9625,Michael,"Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?"
9626,Jim,What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
9627,Michael,"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme..."
9628,Michael,"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley..."
9629,Michael,"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group."
9630,Michael,"Stanley, we're havin a little..."
9631,Michael,We're havin a little brainstorm session...
9632,Michael,"...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water."
9633,Michael,What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
9634,Michael,That? In the conference room?
9635,Michael,"We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said ""did I stutter,"" and I said ""wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?"" It was joking, Toby, alright?"
9636,Michael,"Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: ""Hey um, you're poor."" ""Well hey, you're mama's dead."" That's what friends do. It's... you're so white."
9637,Michael,"Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but..."
9638,Michael,"Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological."
9639,Andy,"You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker."
9640,Andy,That's a racing stripe.
9641,Andy,"Mmm, I doubt that very much."
9642,Dwight,This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
9643,Dwight,"Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey."
9644,Andy,I have to pick one of those?
9645,Andy,Can you go over those options again?
9646,Dwight,"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now."
9647,Andy,"Well I have the, the blue book value..."
9648,Dwight,"Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--"
9649,Andy,Can I think about it?
9650,Dwight,"Five, four, three, two..."
9651,Andy,Let me think about it--
9652,Andy,Let me think about it--
9653,Dwight,Say it. Do it. Now.
9654,Andy,I'm thinking about it--
9655,Dwight,Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
9656,Michael,"I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal."
9657,Michael,"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool."
9658,Dwight,"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?"
9659,Dwight,There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
9660,Dwight,"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly."
9661,Michael,"Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?"
9662,Dwight,"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office."
9663,Michael,I never said you could do that.
9664,Dwight,All you have to do it say it.
9665,Michael,"Okay, I will think about it."
9666,Dwight,"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it."
9667,Dwight,"So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself."
9668,Kevin,"Hey Pam, I really like your glasses."
9669,Kevin,All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
9670,Kevin,"Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually..."
9671,Pam,I should probably get back to...
9672,Kevin,"Could you just say, ""these are due back Thursday""?"
9673,Pam,"No.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. "
9674,Darryl,"I'm very busy here, man."
9675,Michael,"Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?"
9676,Michael,"It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um..."
9677,Michael,"I know, it's very, very personal..."
9678,Darryl,"No, um... I have."
9679,Michael,"I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?"
9680,Darryl,"Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors..."
9681,Michael,"Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you."
9682,Michael,"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?"
9683,Darryl,"Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers."
9684,Darryl,"That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them."
9685,Darryl,"Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone."
9686,Michael,I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
9687,Ryan," I think it's self-explanatory.  Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?"
9688,Ryan,How do you live with a franchise this bad?
9689,Jim,"On a wing and a prayer, mostly."
9690,Ryan,"Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance."
9691,Ryan,"It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
9692,Jim," I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head."
9693,Ryan,"This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it."
9694,Jim,"I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really..."
9695,Ryan,"Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?"
9696,Pam,"Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?"
9697,Jim,"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff..."
9698,Pam,Because you're very important?
9699,Dwight, Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
9700,Andy,What the hell is this all about?  You're flipping my car for profit.
9701,Dwight,It's my car now.
9702,Andy,I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
9703,Dwight,"Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay."
9704,Dwight,"I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight."
9705,Michael,"Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him."
9706,Pam,What does that mean?
9707,Michael,It's like a mock execution.
9708,Jim,That's not a good idea.
9709,Michael,Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
9710,Michael,"No, okay... I've had enough of you."
9711,Oscar,Why are you telling us this?
9712,Michael,"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?"
9713,Kevin,"Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him."
9714,Michael,"I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?"
9715,Michael,"Stanley Hudson, you are fired."
9716,Michael,"I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack."
9717,Michael,"Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice."
9718,Michael,That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
9719,Michael,"All right, all right..."
9720,Michael,"Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out."
9721,Pam,I can't find my glasses.
9722,Jim,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here."
9723,Kevin," It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!"
9724,Michael, I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
9725,Michael,"You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand."
9726,Michael,"Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well."
9727,Michael,"All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it."
9728,Michael,"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after s*x, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, ""I don't respect you!"" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example.  If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck.  Respect is niiice. Borat.  What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!"
9729,Michael,"So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?"
9730,Michael,"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis."
9731,Michael,"Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!"
9732,Michael,"Yeah, I'm pretty excited too."
9733,Michael,"Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place."
9734,Darryl,"Hey, are we doing this thing?"
9735,Michael,Why are you dressed like that?
9736,Michael,Like you're applying for a loan.
9737,Dwight,Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
9738,Darryl,Figured I look presentable.  You?  Went a different way.
9739,Pam, I think you look nice.
9740,Michael,"Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college."
9741,Darryl,What college did you go to Mike?
9742,Jim,"Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try."
9743,Jim,"Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years."
9744,Andy,"Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am... totally and completely kidding!  Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95."
9745,Andy,"Oop, got some blisties."
9746,Andy,"Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender.  It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful."
9747,Kevin,"What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?"
9748,Kevin,"I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent."
9749,Pam,"So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!"
9750,Michael," A little over the top, don't you think?"
9751,Darryl,"Show them what you brought, Mike."
9752,Pam," Um, that's all we brought."
9753,Michael,This is all we need.
9754,Michael,"Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!  Hello!"
9755,Kevin,"Andy, you're up, let's go!"
9756,Andy," Giddy up, let's do this."
9757,Andy,"People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my ""knot"" on."
9758,Dwight,"Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay?  Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will -  He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences."
9759,Dwight,I will tell on you.
9760,Pam,"There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!"
9761,Pam," Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs."
9762,Michael,Hello. Hi.  Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
9763,Pam,"This is Michael, my boss.  Justin."
9764,Michael,"Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, ""only the best and the brightest."""
9765,Pam,He's nice and he seems interested.
9766,Michael,"He's totally wrong, Pam.  Hey."
9767,Michael,"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby."
9768,Michael,"Oh, no problem.  And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately."
9769,Darryl,"Yeah, the booth is lame without it."
9770,Pam,I only brought the one.
9771,Pam,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, ""Are you sure Michael?"" And you said ""Pam! Pam! Pam!"" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, ""Don't worry, it's just allergies."" Do you remember that?"
9772,Pam,Okay. I'll go look for another one. 
9773,Michael,And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
9774,Jim,"Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?"
9775,Jim,Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
9776,Jim,So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
9777,Michael,"Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company..."
9778,Michael,"Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being ""lured"" these days. Thank you Dateline!"
9779,Pam,"My old art room.  Oh, maybe it's still here!  No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind."
9780,Michael, What do you want?
9781,Dwight,"Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day."
9782,Michael,"Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?"
9783,Dwight,So... what else is up?  Mich-
9784,Michael,"Thank you!  What, what is this?"
9785,Pam,A piece of paper.
9786,Michael,This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
9787,Pam,Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
9788,Michael,Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
9789,Michael,Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
9790,Jim,"You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey."
9791,Andy," AH! Come on, Tuna!"
9792,Jim,"Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?"
9793,Pam,"Just checking in, how's it going?"
9794,Jim,"Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see."
9795,Pam,"I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess."
9796,Jim,"Oh, I like you."
9797,Pam,Talk to you later?
9798,Jim,"Yeah. All right. Bye.  All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?"
9799,Andy,"All right, race to the next hole! "
9800,Kevin,Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
9801,Andy,Shortcut! Shortcut!  Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
9802,Michael,"All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck."
9803,Michael,Just-in case. What's your last name?
9804,Michael,This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
9805,Michael,"Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now."
9806,Michael,I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
9807,Michael,"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will ""do"" you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?"
9808,Michael,"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist."
9809,Oscar,"Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?"
9810,Michael,"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special."
9811,Michael,"No, I didn't. You misconstrued me."
9812,Kevin,"Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty."
9813,Jim,"Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?"
9814,Jim,"You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good."
9815,Michael,"Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe."
9816,Pam, Beers? You closed it?
9817,Pam,"Yes! Oh!  Um, congratulations to you, sir. "
9818,Jim,"Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it."
9819,Jim,"Thank you. You know what, screw this! "
9820,Michael,"Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me."
9821,Michael," Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. "
9822,Pam,"I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?"
9823,Pam,Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
9824,Pam,I can do that.
9825,Pam,I don't know any of those.
9826,Pam,New York or Philadelphia.
9827,Pam,"All right. Cool, well... thanks."
9828,Pam,"And uh, I'll look into those."
9829,Pam,New York or Philadelphia.
9830,Dwight," Hello, this is Dwight Schrute.  Hello?"
9831,Jim," Hello, this is Dwight."
9832,Jim,"Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second..."
9833,Dwight,"Jim, what are you doing?"
9834,Jim,And how many would you like?
9835,Dwight,"Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-"
9836,Jim,Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
9837,Dwight, This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
9838,Jim,"Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset."
9839,Dwight," K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail."
9840,Jim," Hello, this is Dwight."
9841,Pam,"Hey, is this Dwight?"
9842,Pam,"Oh my goodness, you sound sexy."
9843,Jim,"Oh, thank you. I've been working out."
9844,Dwight,"Woah, woah, woah, Pam!"
9845,Dwight,Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
9846,Dwight,"No!  Pam, I'm over here!"
9847,Dwight,Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
9848,Jim,Can't do that. Unsanitary.
9849,Dwight,"Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone.  Done."
9850,Jim,"Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine."
9851,Jim,"Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I've married. Tell Fater.  Such a nice woman."
9852,Michael,"Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days."
9853,Michael,"Mornin'.  So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... "
9854,Michael,"First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party."
9855,Angela,We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
9856,Angela,But so far we only have two pictures of him.
9857,Michael,"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets..."
9858,Pam,"Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?"
9859,Michael,"If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?"
9860,Michael,"Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-"
9861,Angela,"You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them."
9862,Michael,I thought that you might say that. 
9863,Michael,"Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. ""Michael, buy a motorcycle."" So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now."
9864,Michael,"I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around."
9865,Pam,So how much antigravity potion do you want?
9866,Angela,"No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating."
9867,Michael,"Phyllis, can you do this?"
9868,Pam,"Hi, can I help you?"
9869,Pam,Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
9870,Jim,No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
9871,Pam,"Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!"
9872,Jim,Yes! So when do you start?
9873,Pam,"I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw ""congratulations"" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack."
9874,Pam,"So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months..."
9875,Jim,"It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great."
9876,Pam,"Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great."
9877,Jim,See how easy that is?
9878,Pam,"I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word ""perfect"" in here!"
9879,Michael, Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
9880,Dwight,So what do we know about her?
9881,Michael,"Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already."
9882,Dwight,I hate her too.
9883,Michael,Why do you hate her?
9884,Dwight,Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
9885,Michael,"You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me."
9886,Dwight,Would that be such a bad thing?
9887,Michael,"Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?"
9888,Michael,We need to sell her an elevator pass.
9889,Dwight,"But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... "
9890,Michael,Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
9891,Michael,"Oh, hey, do you still work here?"
9892,Michael,No. I think I will pass.
9893,Michael,"Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win."
9894,Michael,T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
9895,Michael,"Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet."
9896,Dwight, Have you been introduced to Kevin?
9897,Dwight,"He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain."
9898,Dwight,Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
9899,Dwight,"Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. "
9900,Kevin,I do the numbers.
9901,Kevin,Do you want a M&M?
9902,Kevin,Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
9903,Michael,"Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?"
9904,Michael,I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
9905,Michael,"Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?"
9906,Michael,"You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?"
9907,Pam,Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
9908,Pam,Well I was taking the picture.
9909,Pam,"Sure, do you have a camera here?"
9910,Jim," So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big."
9911,Ryan,Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
9912,Jim,"No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so..."
9913,Ryan,"All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website."
9914,Jim,"All right, well it already went through, so..."
9915,Ryan,Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. 
9916,Michael, Hmm... Jim?  I am downloading some N3P...
9917,Michael,For a CD mix tape...
9918,Michael,And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
9919,Jim,What are the two levels?
9920,Michael,"The two levels being, uh, ""Welcome to Scranton""..."
9921,Michael,"And ""I... love you."""
9922,Jim,"Okay. Let's start with the ""I love you"" level."
9923,Michael,"Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?"
9924,Jim,Yes. You don't love Holly.
9925,Michael,I think I do.
9926,Jim,But you just met her.
9927,Michael,"Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears."
9928,Jim,"Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that."
9929,Michael,"Well, you're not a romantic."
9930,Jim,"Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance."
9931,Jim,We've been through this.
9932,Jim,"Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow."
9933,Michael,"Yeah, you took it too slow."
9934,Jim,"Well, we're really happy."
9935,Michael,This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
9936,Jim,"And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her."
9937,Michael,I don't want her to get away.
9938,Jim,"I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work."
9939,Jim,I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
9940,Jim,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party."
9941,Jim,"Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. "
9942,Jim,"Well we all want a good party, right?"
9943,Jim,I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
9944,Kevin,I can't decide what to get.
9945,Kevin,"Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips."
9946,Kevin,"I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me."
9947,Jim," Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. "
9948,Michael,"Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually."
9949,Michael,"And the sequel, ""Woman Stands at Desk and Works."" So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that."
9950,Michael, Sit on floor and put together chair we will.  Yo-da. Um...
9951,Michael,"So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town."
9952,Michael,"I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point."
9953,Jim,"Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?"
9954,Michael,It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
9955,Jim,"Oh, I'm so glad you didn't."
9956,Michael,"Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base..."
9957,Jim,"There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!"
9958,Angela,"Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack."
9959,Angela,"Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?"
9960,Michael,"Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?"
9961,Michael,"I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'."
9962,Michael,"Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend."
9963,Michael,"Hey! Hi, good to see you."
9964,Michael,I'm just having a little exit interview.
9965,Michael,"Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?"
9966,Pam, Did you need me to take notes?
9967,Michael,"Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?"
9968,Michael,Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
9969,Michael,Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
9970,Michael,Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
9971,Michael,"Well, no no no no no..."
9972,Michael,No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
9973,Pam,"Toby, why don't you open your present?"
9974,Michael,"Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which..."
9975,Michael,What the hell is that?
9976,Michael,"That's... What do you mean, ""Michael""? That's not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!"
9977,Dwight,You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- 
9978,Michael,"Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby."
9979,Pam,So what is your gift?
9980,Michael,"My gift is forthcoming, Pam."
9981,Michael,I am going to give Toby...
9982,Michael,"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?"
9983,Michael,How did you know?
9984,Michael,Well... That's my watch.
9985,Pam,Is that the police?
9986,Oscar,"Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as ""misleading the shareholders."" Another good term is ""fraud."" The real crime, I think, was the beard."
9987,Michael, Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
9988,Jim,Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
9989,Jim," Right to voicemail.  Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! "
9990,Michael, I'm just worried about my friend.
9991,Michael,"Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run."
9992,Michael,"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level."
9993,Kevin, Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
9994,Michael,"No antigravity machine, huh?"
9995,Michael,Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
9996,Pam,Wow. Look at our parking lot.
9997,Jim,"Yeah, who'd have thought? "
9998,Pam,"Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?"
9999,Michael,That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
10000,Dwight,"Okay, here we go. Here we go.  Put it in. "
10001,Michael,Hey. What are you doing?
10002,Michael,What the hell is going on here?!
10003,Dwight,N-nothing you need to know the details of.
10004,Michael,"There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!"
10005,Michael,Why did you do that?
10006,Dwight,It was playful hazing.
10007,Michael,"No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?"
10008,Dwight,"Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out."
10009,Michael,"Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! "
10010,Kevin,Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
10011,Michael," Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band.  You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?"
10012,Michael,"Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter."
10013,Michael,"I have done things like um, ""Beers in Heaven."""
10014,Michael,"Or, ""Total Eclipse of the Fart."""
10015,Jim,"Not my favorite, but..."
10016,Pam,I like that one.
10017,Jim,It's not my favorite...
10018,Pam,I like that one.
10019,Michael,"I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, ""Goodbye Stranger""? Supertramp?"
10020,Michael, It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
10021,Pam,"I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office."
10022,Michael," Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise..."
10023,Pam,"Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute."
10024,Michael," Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!"
10025,Michael,"Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual.  Sorry. Kevin.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy."
10026,Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here."
10027,Michael,Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
10028,Kevin,"No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see."
10029,Michael,Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
10030,Michael,"Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back."
10031,Kevin,"It was great to see you, Jan."
10032,Michael,"Wow, Kevin, really? We're-  Sorry. We're in the middle of a party.  Is this why you called me down here?"
10033,Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, I just uh..."
10034,Kevin,I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
10035,Michael,Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you!  Are you nauseous?
10036,Michael,"Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?"
10037,Michael,Good. Good. Thank God.
10038,Michael,"Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy..."
10039,Michael,"Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very..."
10040,Michael,You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
10041,Michael,"So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so..."
10042,Michael,When we were going out?
10043,Michael,W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
10044,Michael,You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
10045,Michael,I'm glad you told me.
10046,Michael,"Um, I'll... I have to think about it."
10047,Michael,"My whole life, I have known two things: I love s*x, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other."
10048,Pam,"Oh look, they're starting. "
10049,Angela," Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again."
10050,Andy," Can I have your attention please?  I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage?  Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. "
10051,Andy,"Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? "
10052,Andy,"Into the mic, sweetie."
10053,Andy,She said yes!  And the crowd goes wild! Woo! 
10054,Andy,"I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right."
10055,Dwight,Well... it's my own fault.
10056,Jim,"I know. That's awesome, man. That's great."
10057,Andy,Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
10058,Pam,"Sure. Meredith, do you mind?"
10059,Pam,"I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight..."
10060,Michael,"Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh..."
10061,Michael,"Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there."
10062,Kevin,I'll go to the diner with you.
10063,Kevin,"Yeah, we can go eat pie."
10064,Michael,Have a good night.
10065,Michael,Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
10066,Michael,You might take something.
10067,Michael," Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning.  I am going to be... kind of a daddy."
10068,Michael,"All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. "
10069,Dwight,"From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more."
10070,Michael,"This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days."
10071,Dwight,"No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers."
10072,Dwight, There. Take those home to your wife.
10073,Dwight,"Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up."
10074,Darryl,Don't go breaking my scale.
10075,Andy,"I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked."
10076,Michael,"No, I will ex-squeeze you."
10077,Michael,OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
10078,Dwight,Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
10079,Darryl,"2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control."
10080,Dwight,Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
10081,Michael,"Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only."
10082,Darryl,"All right, got it. 2,210 pounds."
10083,Kevin,"Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?"
10084,Pam,"Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200..."
10085,Pam,"Just, we'll just keep going."
10086,Andy,I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
10087,Oscar,All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
10088,Andy,Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
10089,Oscar,"OK.  Stanley, come on."
10090,Jim,"Ah, they moved the shower."
10091,Michael,Did you see Holly's butt?
10092,Jim,"No, I didn't.  You know why?"
10093,Jim,"Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts."
10094,Jim,But what have you learned about her?
10095,Michael,"I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read ""Lonesome Dove"" three times."
10096,Michael,And that her butt refuses to quit!
10097,Michael, You have to agree with me.  That's insane.
10098,Jim,I'll just go later.
10099,Michael,I thought you had to pee.
10100,Oscar,"Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City."
10101,Oscar,Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
10102,Oscar,"Oh, you think it's a choice?"
10103,Oscar,"I'm messing with you, Holly."
10104,Jim,So you have the directions.
10105,Jim,You have a toothbrush.
10106,Jim,You have a cell phone charger.
10107,Pam,"Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple.  What up, 212?"
10108,Dwight,Fax this for me.
10109,Jim,"Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes."
10110,Dwight,"It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim.  If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind."
10111,Andy,"Ang. Ela.  Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--"
10112,Andy,"Hey, check it out.  This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper."
10113,Andy,Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
10114,Andy,This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
10115,Andy,"OK. How do you feel about Maine?  I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. "
10116,Dwight," Ahh. We done good in there, half pint."
10117,Angela,"Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it."
10118,Angela,"No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!"
10119,Michael," Hey, hey!  Pam, Pam! Hey!"
10120,Michael, I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
10121,Pam,I should really get going.
10122,Michael,"No. OK. Um, the last word is ""seagulls."""
10123,Pam,I'm sure it was really lovely.
10124,Michael,I took a lot from other poems.
10125,Jim,Call me when you get in. 
10126,Jim,"Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here..."
10127,Michael,"OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week."
10128,Angela,"It doesn't matter, Michael."
10129,Michael,"Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go."
10130,Darryl,"OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds."
10131,Jim,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork."
10132,Michael," I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!"
10133,Jim,"I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her."
10134,Pam,I'm in the wrong class...
10135,Pam,"Oh, no. I just--"
10136,Kevin,How's the candle game?
10137,Kevin,"Cool. Thank God they found her, too."
10138,Michael,"Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't.  Come on. Let's go in."
10139,Jim,"When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father."
10140,Oscar,"Yes, she is. And clinically insane."
10141,Angela,"Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it."
10142,Angela,But he's an idiot!
10143,Kevin,"Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?"
10144,Angela,"Oh, Holly, that is very offensive."
10145,Andy,"Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales: Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C."
10146,Angela,Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
10147,Angela," Hurry, we have to make this fast."
10148,Dwight,Let's do this thing.
10149,Angela,"I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!"
10150,Jim,"All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this: Go to applications--"
10151,Pam, I can see you!
10152,Pam,This is so cool.
10153,Jim,"So what is going on, girl in the computer?"
10154,Pam,Lunch with a girl from my hall.
10155,Pam,Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
10156,Dwight,"OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done."
10157,Michael,"No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!"
10158,Pam,Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
10159,Michael,"Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day."
10160,Michael,"Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?"
10161,Pam,They're on the supply shelf.
10162,Michael,Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
10163,Pam,"New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?"
10164,Michael,"OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts."
10165,Darryl,"2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back."
10166,Michael,Damn it. Come on.
10167,Michael,Here we go. Everybody on.
10168,Dwight,"All right, we're set."
10169,Darryl,Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
10170,Michael,Cake? Who suggested cake? 
10171,Michael,"Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis."
10172,Michael,What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having s*x. And then again for seven years.
10173,Michael,Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
10174,Jim,That's not what that is.
10175,Michael,"Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?"
10176,Jim,I would like to lose 65 pounds.
10177,Michael,"Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?"
10178,Angela,No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
10179,Michael,"If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?"
10180,Jim,Cryogenics. Beer me five.
10181,Michael,This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
10182,Jim,"All right, I'm taking off."
10183,Jim,"Nope, just going to see Pam."
10184,Jim,Maybe put up some shelves.
10185,Michael,Wait a second.  I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
10186,Jim,"OK, thank you for ... this."
10187,Andy,I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
10188,Angela,It's not my problem. 
10189,Andy,Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
10190,Angela,"That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. "
10191,Andy,"Sweetheart.  Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together."
10192,Angela,I know I haven't made this easy on you. 
10193,Jim,"Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. "
10194,Michael, It's a pretty lame party.
10195,Jim, Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
10196,Dwight,"Michael, we have a situation."
10197,Dwight,They should not be in that room.
10198,Michael,You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
10199,Michael,"Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time."
10200,Dwight,Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
10201,Michael,You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
10202,Michael,"Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her."
10203,Dwight,Party's over. You are so busted!
10204,Michael,"OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?"
10205,Michael,And what is that?
10206,Michael,"You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing."
10207,Ryan, How's my favorite branch doing?  All right .
10208,Michael,"Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him."
10209,Ryan,And you got a goatee!
10210,Ryan,Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
10211,Ryan,Hey Kevin...  That's really funny.
10212,Ryan,It's great to see you Kev.
10213,Ryan,"I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list."
10214,Ryan,Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community.
10215,Jim,Well that's great.  You're talking about your court ordered community service?
10216,Ryan,I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
10217,Jim,"But he did, right?"
10218,Darryl,Well you lost zero pounds.  No change. On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
10219,Michael,"Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. "
10220,Andy,"Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking?"
10221,Andy,NO! I want names!
10222,Andy,This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life.
10223,Oscar,So how was your date?
10224,Michael,Close the door. This is your fault.
10225,Michael,Your stupid friend zone.
10226,Michael,"I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!"
10227,Dwight,Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left.  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
10228,Jim,"How much weight have you lost, Dwight?"
10229,Dwight,"I am hardly the problem, Jim."
10230,Jim,"No, you're definitely the problem."
10231,Dwight,"This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills."
10232,Ryan,"I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed."
10233,Ryan,We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight?
10234,Ryan,"That--- I, um... cool. Well maybe I'll see you around."
10235,Dwight,Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.
10236,Dwight,"But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?"
10237,Dwight, Sixty - forty. Hm?  I'll drive.
10238,Jim,"Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers."
10239,Pam,"Wow, was it the age difference?"
10240,Pam,"Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!"
10241,Oscar,"Oh my God, what happened?"
10242,Dwight,"And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! "
10243,Dwight,"Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about?  You look great. I can definitely see the difference."
10244,Michael, Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
10245,Michael,"I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful."
10246,Michael,It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
10247,Michael,Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society.
10248,Jim,"See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you."
10249,Michael,"If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, ""Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"""
10250,Kevin,Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
10251,Michael,How do you know Michael Clump?
10252,Oscar,Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
10253,Michael,How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
10254,Oscar,"I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, ""I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"""
10255,Dwight,"No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, ""I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"""
10256,Michael,"No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man."
10257,Michael,"Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?"
10258,Dwight,"Eh, I've been sitting all day."
10259,Michael,We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  Hey. Hey. You shaved?
10260,Michael,"Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march."
10261,Dwight,She should thank me.
10262,Michael,"Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first."
10263,Michael,"You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok."
10264,Dwight, I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
10265,Michael,"Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat?  Let's all clap at Phyllis.  Ok!  When Michael Clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly.  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go.  Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?"
10266,Michael,"Ok, be more specific."
10267,Michael,What about her looks?
10268,Michael,"Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?"
10269,Michael,"I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug.  Mmmmmm."
10270,Jim,Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer?
10271,Michael,"Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers."
10272,Oscar,How was Friday night?
10273,Michael,"Oscar, enough with the girl talk please."
10274,Darryl,You guys lost four pounds.
10275,Darryl,I say we have a parade.
10276,Jim,"So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so..."
10277,Pam,You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you.
10278,Jim,I know. I suck.
10279,Dwight,"I do not! I do not say ""Hi"" Pam!"
10280,Jim,"Now he is saying ""Hi"" louder."
10281,Pam,"I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?"
10282,Pam,"No football games, recitals, karate tournaments."
10283,Jim,"Hey, can you go to IM?"
10284,Jim,Let's meet for lunch.
10285,Dwight,What are you writing about me?
10286,Dwight,I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
10287,Jim,I'm gonna write you up for not working.
10288,Dwight,"Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working."
10289,Michael,"Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?"
10290,Michael,"No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?"
10291,Michael,"I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco."
10292,Michael,"Wait, do we have until the end of the day?"
10293,Andy,"Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight.  It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge."
10294,Andy,Andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
10295,Michael," Hey, is that healthy food?"
10296,Michael,"We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?"
10297,Jim,"Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late."
10298,Michael,"Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?"
10299,Angela,I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
10300,Andy,Your wish is my command.
10301,Angela,"Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?"
10302,Andy,Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know?
10303,Andy,And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
10304,Andy,I didn't tell you.
10305,Andy,"Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em."
10306,Angela,I don't think that...
10307,Andy,"And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out."
10308,Angela,I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
10309,Andy,"Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for."
10310,Angela, Let's talk about this later. 
10311,Pam,"Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch."
10312,Pam,What are you doing?
10313,Jim,I just... couldn't wait.
10314,Jim,"Pam, will you marry me?"
10315,Dwight,God. Where is Jim?
10316,Michael,"I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing..."
10317,Michael,...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
10318,Michael,I know. I love Counting Crows.
10319,Michael,That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you.
10320,Michael,"I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do."
10321,Michael,"Alright. Alright!  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so..."
10322,Dwight,What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.
10323,Michael,"Darryl, would you do the honors?"
10324,Darryl,Two thousand one hundred seventy-five.  Sorry guys.
10325,Michael,"Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers."
10326,Pam," Well, I should go."
10327,Jim,Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
10328,Pam,"No, don't. I'm mad at them."
10329,Pam,Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
10330,Jim,Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
10331,Jim,"I just didn't, you know, want a deal."
10332,Pam,"Come on, it won't be that bad."
10333,Jim,"OK. You know what? Here we go.  Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged."
10334,Oscar,I thought you were already engaged.
10335,Angela,That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.
10336,Kevin,I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?
10337,Andy,"A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?"
10338,Dwight," She's not a virgin, you know."
10339,Pam,"No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi. "
10340,Dwight," I got it, I got it. "
10341,Michael,"""Why are you helping her? You're not even dating."" She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh..."
10342,Michael,"Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! "
10343,Kevin,"Oh come on! He's right there.  He was hired.  Oh check it out, ""Hired Guy."""
10344,Ryan,"Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six?  Anyone know Joanna on that show?  In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So..."
10345,Michael," Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy."
10346,Michael,"Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. "
10347,Michael, Can't set 'em up like that.
10348,Michael,Can we have a moment?  Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
10349,Dwight,What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
10350,Michael,"Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan."
10351,Michael,Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
10352,Michael," Lauren,  enough with the pencils."
10353,Oscar,That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
10354,Andy,I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
10355,Dwight,"It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male."
10356,Andy,No that's... not how it works.
10357,Michael,I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.
10358,Michael,"Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on."
10359,Michael,I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
10360,Michael,To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
10361,Michael,"Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly."
10362,Oscar,"Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch."
10363,Dwight,Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!
10364,Jim,"Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?"
10365,Michael,You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?
10366,Michael,Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?
10367,Angela,"I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it."
10368,Michael,"Well, let's keep this party movin' on."
10369,Michael,"That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got?  You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work.   Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate."
10370,Michael,"Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around."
10371,Michael,"No... no, this is just a stupid formality."
10372,Dwight,What are you doing?
10373,Jim,Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
10374,Dwight,"Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd.  Really?  Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti--- "
10375,Jim,Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.
10376,Dwight,There is no way that that was--- 
10377,Michael,"Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk."
10378,Michael,"Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out."
10379,Michael,Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
10380,Michael,"Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady.  Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical."
10381,Michael,What do you think? What do you think of this place?
10382,Michael,"Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?"
10383,Michael,"Wow, that sounds so... warm."
10384,Michael,Here too. You know what my favorite season is?
10385,Michael,"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons."
10386,Jim,"By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?"
10387,Andy,"No, I did not. Was that any good?"
10388,Jim,Actually not. It was really so-so.
10389,Jim,"I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but...  Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?"
10390,Andy,Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
10391,Jim,"You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake."
10392,Andy,"Really?  Huh, that's cool."
10393,Jim,Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
10394,Andy,Really? That doesn't sound right.
10395,Michael,"I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money."
10396,Michael,"Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her."
10397,Michael,"Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months."
10398,Michael,"I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key."
10399,Michael,"No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the..."
10400,Jim,"He has not stopped working for a second. At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today."
10401,Michael,I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
10402,Michael,Well... bleh busted. I don't...
10403,Michael,"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family."
10404,Michael,I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers. 
10405,Jim, 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
10406,Dwight,None of your business.
10407,Jim,So I guess I can assume that was personal.
10408,Jim,So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
10409,Dwight,"Yes, maybe I'm not. "
10410,Ryan,Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
10411,Michael,What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
10412,Michael,"I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man."
10413,Michael,Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
10414,Michael,"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, ""I told you so."" Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way."
10415,Michael,"Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you."
10416,Michael,Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! 
10417,Michael,"Now is really not the time, Meredith."
10418,Kevin,I think we're out.
10419,Andy,"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?"
10420,Kevin,"I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash."
10421,Dwight,Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
10422,Michael,"OK, just remember to keep breathing."
10423,Dwight,My cervix is ripening.
10424,Jim," Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through  delusion."
10425,Dwight,Michael! My water's breaking!
10426,Dwight,Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
10427,Michael,I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
10428,Dwight,Right. Highways or surface roads?
10429,Michael,I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
10430,Dwight,"No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!"
10431,Michael,"I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby."
10432,Dwight,It's about adapting to the circumstances.
10433,Michael," Andy, would you like to have my baby?"
10434,Andy,Yes! Yeah.  Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
10435,Dwight,"No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa! "
10436,Michael,"All right, OK.  Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!"
10437,Dwight,The pressure! The pressure!
10438,Michael,"Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out."
10439,Dwight,"Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision."
10440,Michael,"I'm right here, I'm right here."
10441,Dwight,"I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!"
10442,Michael, All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
10443,Dwight,Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
10444,Michael,"Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late."
10445,Dwight,No! I don't want natural!
10446,Michael,No. You have to just push it out!
10447,Dwight,Do you have the Sharpie?!
10448,Dwight,Do you have the Sharpie?!
10449,Dwight,"OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy."
10450,Michael,Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
10451,Dwight,Butter. Newborns are slippery.
10452,Michael,Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.
10453,Michael, It is going to be the happiest day of my life. 
10454,Michael,"Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks?"
10455,Michael,"Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry.  Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?"
10456,Angela,"Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name ""Chevy."" And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name ""Astird."""
10457,Angela,"Michael wrote down ""Astird."""
10458,Michael,She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
10459,Michael,"I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?"
10460,Michael,"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens."
10461,Kevin,"But Phyllis, it's not his baby."
10462,Oscar,Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
10463,Michael," Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them."
10464,Michael,"Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!"
10465,Pam," So you know Stacy, right?"
10466,Jim,"Right, the one from England."
10467,Pam,"There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages."
10468,Jim,"Oh. Right, that style."
10469,Pam,"So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab."
10470,Pam,"Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in."
10471,Jim,"Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?"
10472,Pam,"No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres."
10473,Pam,"So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, ""No way. You can't reserve seats."" And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box."
10474,Jim,Ha ha. That's hilarious?
10475,Pam,"No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested."
10476,Pam,"No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me?"
10477,Pam,"Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. "
10478,Jim,"OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later.  That was a good story."
10479,Andy,Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here?
10480,Angela,It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
10481,Andy,Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
10482,Angela,"Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert."
10483,Andy,"Why would that make me a pervert, I -"
10484,Angela,"Well, it does. That's me."
10485,Andy,"That's mean, come on, that's - "
10486,Michael,"Ahoy. So, how you doin'?"
10487,Michael,"Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way."
10488,Jim,What do we have here?
10489,Dwight,Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.
10490,Michael,So this is Astird.
10491,Michael,"Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?"
10492,Michael,I could have helped.
10493,Michael,"Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways."
10494,Michael,Can I hold her?
10495,Michael,"I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion."
10496,Michael," Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst..."
10497,Michael,"...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life."
10498,Michael," Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go.  Lion King!"
10499,Michael,"OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop."
10500,Michael," I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in."
10501,Michael,Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
10502,Kevin,"Michael, the baby's already been born."
10503,Kevin,So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
10504,Michael,"No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do."
10505,Kevin,OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
10506,Michael,"All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes."
10507,Angela,"Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller."
10508,Michael,She already has a stroller.
10509,Oscar,She's got an Orbit
10510,Dwight,Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
10511,Dwight,"Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. "
10512,Pam,Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
10513,Jim,"OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and everyone's just staring at her."
10514,Pam,"I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-"
10515,Jim,"The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!"
10516,Pam,I can't hear anything!
10517,Jim,"Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later."
10518,Pam,"I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick."
10519,Dwight," Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!"
10520,Dwight, Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
10521,Andy,"So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth."
10522,Angela,You gave birth in a tub?
10523,Michael,"Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this."
10524,Michael,I could have helped.
10525,Michael," I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged."
10526,Michael,Phyllis? Could you take-.
10527,Michael,"Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another."
10528,Darryl,You a baby daddy?
10529,Michael,"Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?"
10530,Darryl,Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.
10531,Michael,I just saw this baby daddy-
10532,Darryl,"You should stop calling yourself ""baby daddy."""
10533,Michael,"Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?"
10534,Darryl,"Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby."
10535,Darryl,You feel connected to his baby over there?
10536,Darryl,You feel connected to this? 
10537,Michael,That's not a baby.
10538,Darryl,"You want to hold me, to see how you feel?"
10539,Angela," That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready?"
10540,Andy,OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook!
10541,Angela,"Now. Come on, up here!"
10542,Angela,Your hand's in it.
10543,Angela,"Yeah, that's a good one."
10544,Andy,We're taking a picture.
10545,Michael," I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt."
10546,Dwight,I like to call this... the bumper test. 
10547,Michael,Sure you can't stay a little longer?
10548,Michael,"All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving."
10549,Dwight,Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
10550,Michael,"Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine."
10551,Michael, You wanna go out?
10552,Michael,"I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly."
10553,Jim," Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message."
10554,Pam," Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message."
10555,Jim," Hey, it's me. It is 5:03."
10556,Pam,"I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but..."
10557,Jim,You must be out or something.
10558,Pam,I'll leave a message.
10559,Jim,"Is it me, or are we just a little off today?"
10560,Pam,I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.
10561,Jim,Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
10562,Pam,I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
10563,Jim,Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
10564,Pam,"And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?"
10565,Jim,"Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe."
10566,Pam,"You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home."
10567,Jim,"Wish you were home. Uh, anyway..."
10568,Pam,"Anyway, um... I miss you."
10569,Pam,"New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate."
10570,Pam,"Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week."
10571,Michael,Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
10572,Michael,That was really fun last night.
10573,Michael,I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
10574,Michael,"I, uh...  I let her win."
10575,Michael,"So, when, um, can I see you again?"
10576,Michael,"Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.  Because I am busy taking you out."
10577,Michael,"Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight..."
10578,Michael,"Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day."
10579,Michael,"In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have s*x. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure."
10580,Andy,"That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date."
10581,Dwight, You set a date?
10582,Andy,"J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money."
10583,Dwight,You got a better way?
10584,Dwight,"I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know."
10585,Michael,"Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?"
10586,Michael,"Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first."
10587,Michael,Probably get soup or something light.
10588,Dwight,"She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine."
10589,Dwight,I was talking to myself.
10590,Dwight,I just don't get it.
10591,Dwight,Why is she marrying Andy?
10592,Michael,"No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.   I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy."
10593,Michael,Do you need 'em?
10594,Michael,Thank vous.  What? Oh! 
10595,Michael,Not if we turn these dials  all the way down.  Now they can't hear us at all.
10596,Angela,"Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000."
10597,Oscar,"Great, they stole my laptop."
10598,Kevin,"Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector."
10599,Oscar,How does that even compare?
10600,Kevin,"Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges."
10601,Michael,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
10602,Jim,We were robbed last night.
10603,Dwight,"Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have."
10604,Michael,"Oh, no, my God."
10605,Michael,So much for s*x without consequences.
10606,Pam, You are such a dork! Shots!
10607,Jim,"So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning."
10608,Jim,I'm on minute six of this message.
10609,Pam,"Okay, I do not sound like that."
10610,Jim,The future mother of my children.
10611,Angela,I never felt safe here.
10612,Andy,"You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind."
10613,Angela,I would very much like that.
10614,Andy, Consider yourself... at home!
10615,Dwight,"I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so."
10616,Dwight,Are you sure that's going to work?
10617,Dwight,"Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight..."
10618,Oscar,I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
10619,Michael,"We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?"
10620,Michael,"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty."
10621,Michael,"Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?"
10622,Michael,"Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days."
10623,Oscar,"So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?"
10624,Michael,"I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-"
10625,Jim,Do you need us for any of this?
10626,Michael,"Yeah, I think that's pretty boss."
10627,Dwight,"Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. "
10628,Angela,I think you have me confused with another person.
10629,Dwight,I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
10630,Michael,"Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.  And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.  Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! "
10631,Darryl,"Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People."
10632,Michael,"Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.  It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars.  300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400- Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450  Sold! For 300 dollars to me!  What the hell is that?"
10633,Michael,"It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!"
10634,Darryl,"Hey Mike, do my thing."
10635,Michael,"Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-"
10636,Darryl,"Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest."
10637,Michael,"Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says ""Creed."""
10638,Darryl,She thought I was McNabb. 
10639,Jim,I can see that.
10640,Darryl,"Yeah, well, watcha gonna do?"
10641,Jim,"Another round, boys? Great. "
10642,Jim,I'm good. How you doing?
10643,Darryl,"Oh, what's up, Roy?"
10644,Kevin,"Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes."
10645,Michael,"Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man."
10646,Michael,"Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage."
10647,Michael,"We are getting there folks. Slow and steady.  Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!"
10648,Dwight,"Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick."
10649,Michael,Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
10650,Dwight,I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. 
10651,Dwight,"Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?"
10652,Dwight,"Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?"
10653,Dwight,"Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan."
10654,Dwight,Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish.  And you slap like a girl.
10655,Dwight,What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. 
10656,Jim,"Oh, she's good actually."
10657,Jim,"She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school."
10658,Jim,"Yeah, she's doing really well."
10659,Jim,"She's engaged, um... to me."
10660,Jim,"Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that."
10661,Jim,"Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM."
10662,Jim, I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. 
10663,Michael,"Uh, just a few more items."
10664,Michael,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item.  All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?"
10665,Michael,"No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody."
10666,Michael,"Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so."
10667,Michael,"She's your wife, you idiot."
10668,Michael,"Uh, what the hell is happening?"
10669,Angela,What are you doing?
10670,Andy,"I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one."
10671,Michael,"300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice."
10672,Dwight,300 and one penny.
10673,Michael,"300 and one penny, 300 and one penny."
10674,Dwight,350 and one penny.
10675,Michael,350 and one penny.
10676,Michael,"400, 400 hey batter batter."
10677,Dwight,400 and one penny.
10678,Michael,400 and one penny.
10679,Dwight,500 and one penny.
10680,Michael,500 and one penny. One million dollar!
10681,Dwight,700 and one penny.
10682,Dwight,"Eh, it's not worth it."
10683,Michael,"1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar.  Nicely done."
10684,Jim, No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And  we are not that couple. 
10685,Michael," Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- "
10686,Ryan,"I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing."
10687,Kevin, Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
10688,Andy," Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?"
10689,Jim,You are?  A cat?
10690,Andy," We were looking for ""kitten."""
10691,Jim," Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert."
10692,Jim,"Hey New York, Happy Halloween!"
10693,Pam,Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention. 
10694,Pam,"So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler."
10695,Dwight, Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh!  Disappear.
10696,Michael,"Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets."
10697,Michael,"When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire."
10698,Michael,"Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again."
10699,Darryl,Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
10700,Michael,We're not doing anything.
10701,Michael,"All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge."
10702,Jim,"Oh, I'll walk you out."
10703,Michael,"Ah, you are quite the gentleman."
10704,Michael,You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
10705,Jim,All right. We'll see.  No.
10706,Jim,"I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two."
10707,Ryan,'Morning.  Wow. Good morning Dwight.
10708,Dwight,Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?
10709,Andy,Ha ha ha. That's funny.  Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.
10710,Andy,"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them."
10711,Dwight,"No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!"
10712,Andy,"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?"
10713,Dwight,"Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine."
10714,Dwight,"I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy."
10715,Dwight,"Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. "
10716,Darryl,Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
10717,Michael,"We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song."
10718,Dwight,"Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong."
10719,Andy,"Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying ""we."" You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me."
10720,Dwight,"Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage."
10721,Andy,"I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red."
10722,Dwight,"Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this."
10723,Pam,How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
10724,Pam,"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, ""That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best."""
10725,Pam,"Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it."
10726,Pam,"So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?"
10727,Pam,They came up with that idea really fast.
10728,Darryl,This trip was longer than I thought.
10729,Michael,Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
10730,Michael,Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
10731,Michael,"All right. What's the scoop, how far?"
10732,Darryl,Four hours. Almost halfway there.
10733,Michael,"Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast."
10734,Darryl,Next exit isn't for five miles.
10735,Jim,"Hey, how are you?"
10736,Jim,Good to see you.
10737,Jim,All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
10738,Darryl,There's nothing out here man.
10739,Michael,"Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon."
10740,Michael,"Here we go, fourth time's a charm. ""Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there....  Hey. Are you crying?"
10741,Michael,Did Darryl touch you?
10742,Michael,"Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine."
10743,Michael,Listen to me. I like you so much.
10744,Michael,And I've dated four women in the last--
10745,Michael,Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
10746,Michael,"I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid."
10747,Michael,That's what she said.
10748,Michael,"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be."
10749,Andy,I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
10750,Andy,"It's pronounced ""Corn-ell!"" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!"
10751,Dwight,"Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work."
10752,Dwight,What do you say?
10753,Andy,"Yeah, good. Can we---  Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!"
10754,Michael,"Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way."
10755,Michael,"I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road."
10756,Michael,Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
10757,Michael,"Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy."
10758,Michael,"My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy."
10759,Jim,That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
10760,Jim,"Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?"
10761,Michael,"You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?"
10762,Michael,Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. 
10763,Darryl," Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit."
10764,Michael,I don't know what I'm gonna do!
10765,Darryl,Please call me back.
10766,Michael,I'm not gonna be okay.
10767,Michael,"No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!"
10768,Andy, You might be interested- 
10769,Dwight,"Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?"
10770,Andy,"Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview."
10771,Dwight,That's a conflict of interest.
10772,Andy,"Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?"
10773,Andy,"Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer."
10774,Andy,Who are your role models?
10775,Andy,"If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance."
10776,Andy,"So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great."
10777,Jim,"Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her."
10778,Jim,That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
10779,Jim,Here you go again! What is your deal today?
10780,Jim,Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
10781,Pam,I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
10782,Jim,"Pam, don't worry about it."
10783,Pam,"I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So..."
10784,Jim,"Guys, what is going on?! "
10785,Andy,Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
10786,Andy,Who was Cornell's eighth president?
10787,Andy,"Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins.  Comprehension skills, sub-par."
10788,Dwight,"Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. "
10789,Andy,What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
10790,Dwight,"On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers."
10791,Andy,"Nobody wants ...that, to happen."
10792,Dwight,"Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested."
10793,Andy,"""Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."""
10794,Dwight,"""Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."""
10795,Andy,"""Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations."""
10796,Dwight,"""Interviewer has suspect motives."""
10797,Andy,"""Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."""
10798,Dwight,"""Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth."" Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need."
10799,Andy,I have everything I need- 
10800,Dwight,And you will be hearing from the -
10801,Andy,And you will be hearing from -
10802,Andy,which I will not be a part of-
10803,Dwight,And you will not be pleased with the result. 
10804,Andy,And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
10805,Dwight,And your affiliation with Cornell -
10806,Andy,And your affiliation with Cornell -
10807,Dwight," That is all sir, you may go."
10808,Darryl," There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp."
10809,Pam,"For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better."
10810,Jim,"Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?"
10811,Pam,"Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle."
10812,Jim,"Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.  Oh, text message from my brother. ""Pam cool. Welcome to the family."""
10813,Pam,Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
10814,Darryl,This is the last of it.
10815,Michael,"Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck."
10816,Michael,"You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you."
10817,Darryl,But you want me to put it back in the truck.
10818,Michael,I'll be down in just a second.  Holly?
10819,Michael,So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl  Okay.  Goodbye.
10820,Darryl,I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
10821,Michael,We didn't break up.
10822,Darryl,"Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues."
10823,Darryl, Da na na na na... da na na na na...
10824,Michael,That's a really pretty song.
10825,Darryl,"Da na na na na. No, no, check it out, look. Da na na na na... want to do that?"
10826,Darryl,"That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?"
10827,Darryl,Da na na na na.
10828,Michael,Da na na na na.
10829,Darryl,Da na na na na.
10830,Michael,Da na na na na.
10831,Darryl,"No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da na na na na."
10832,Michael,Da na na na na.
10833,Darryl,Da na na na na.
10834,Michael,Da na na na na.
10835,Darryl,Da na na na na!!
10836,Michael,Da na na na na!!
10837,Darryl,Da na na na na .
10838,Michael, Da na na na na.
10839,Darryl,Yeah! Da na na na na.
10840,Michael, Da na na na na.
10841,Darryl,YEAH! Da na na na na.
10842,Michael, Da na na na na...
10843,Andy," I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?"
10844,Dwight,Where did you get those?
10845,Andy,"What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state."
10846,Dwight,I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
10847,Andy,"Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm.  You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?"
10848,Dwight,"I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? "
10849,Dwight,"Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!"
10850,Darryl,"I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay."
10851,Andy,"Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly."
10852,Michael,"No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam."
10853,Jim,"Yeah, we'd never do that."
10854,Michael,"Yeah, so there you go."
10855,Michael,"Oh, wow, so quickly."
10856,Kevin,"Michael, did you tell your mom yet?"
10857,Michael,Nope. Nope. Not yet.
10858,Jim,You wouldn't tell your mom?
10859,Kevin,You love your mom.
10860,Michael,I'll call her later.
10861,Michael,I don't want to do that.  All right.  She is going to freak out!
10862,Michael,"Mom, I'm getting married."
10863,Michael,"Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me."
10864,Michael,"I'm not, I'm not getting married. So...  Psych."
10865,Michael,And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
10866,Michael,I'll take care of that for you.  Thanks.
10867,Michael,"Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. ""Schindler's List"" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no."
10868,Jim,"Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger."
10869,Pam," Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work."
10870,Pam,"It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something."
10871,Jim," Testing, testing. Hello, everybody."
10872,Pam,"We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone."
10873,Michael,"Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did."
10874,Dwight,What does it say?
10875,Michael,"Dwight, your feedback is horrible."
10876,Michael,A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
10877,Dwight,I sell more paper than anyone. 
10878,Michael,"No, no, no, no, no."
10879,Dwight,"Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes."
10880,Michael,Do I look like I am joking?
10881,Dwight,"No, but that's sometimes part of it."
10882,Michael,"If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?"
10883,Dwight,Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
10884,Andy,"Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?"
10885,Andy,I got mine. They were really good.
10886,Jim,You must be really proud.
10887,Andy,"Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug."
10888,Jim,"Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here."
10889,Andy,"Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one."
10890,Jim,"OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use  uh, oh -- Snoopy."
10891,Pam,Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
10892,Andy, It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
10893,Jim,How can you even be sure?
10894,Andy,It has my face on it.
10895,Jim," Make the face.  Yeah, I don't see it."
10896,Andy,"Dude, that is my face!"
10897,Jim,Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
10898,Pam,Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
10899,Jim,"It is... more of a spicy brown, actually."
10900,Dwight,What are you mumbling about?
10901,Jim,How was your meeting with Michael?
10902,Dwight,None of your business.
10903,Jim,Was it your scores?
10904,Dwight,"Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --"
10905,Dwight,And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
10906,Jim,Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
10907,Michael,"Jimbo, let's do this thang."
10908,Jim,That is me. Wish me luck.
10909,Dwight,I didn't say anything
10910,Jim,"I love you, too."
10911,Dwight,What do you think I am saying to you?!
10912,Jim,I'm not talking to you.
10913,Dwight,"I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser."
10914,Andy," Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work."
10915,Andy,I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him.  I got him!
10916,Andy," Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous."
10917,Jim,Did my scores drop a little?
10918,Michael,"Jim, they are a poopy. "
10919,Jim,Are we even sure that's my file?
10920,Michael,"No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --"
10921,Jim,"Well, there's got to be an explanation."
10922,Michael,So let's see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
10923,Jim,I think you mean smug
10924,Jim,"Michael, I'm just trying to --"
10925,Michael,And there's our smudgeness.
10926,Jim,"I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise.  Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year."
10927,Pam,Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
10928,Jim,A little bit. ... Worth it.
10929,Michael,"Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?"
10930,Michael,"Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go."
10931,Dwight,"All right, fine.  Brrring."
10932,Dwight,"Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company."
10933,Jim,"Wow, that's great, because I need paper."
10934,Dwight,"Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything."
10935,Jim,"Wow, this is my lucky day."
10936,Michael, Ask him his name.
10937,Dwight,"What is your name, sir?"
10938,Jim,I am Bill Buttlicker.
10939,Dwight,"Really, that's your real name?"
10940,Jim,"How dare you? My family built this country, by the way."
10941,Jim,Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
10942,Dwight,"What? No, but I --"
10943,Jim,"Hello?  No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. "
10944,Michael,It's up to you to change his mind.
10945,Jim,Sorry. That was a family emergency.
10946,Dwight,"Oh, no. What's wrong?"
10947,Jim,You know what? That's private.
10948,Michael,"Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!"
10949,Dwight,"Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--"
10950,Jim,"Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing."
10951,Michael,He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
10952,Dwight,"OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --"
10953,Jim,You're gonna have to talk louder.
10954,Dwight,"OK, our prices have never been lower."
10955,Jim,"Son, you have to talk louder."
10956,Dwight, Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
10957,Michael,Stop it! Stop it!
10958,Michael,That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
10959,Jim,"Now, you listen to me, sir."
10960,Jim,"The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult."
10961,Michael,Give me the phone.
10962,Dwight,"Please, Mr. Buttlicker --"
10963,Jim,I'm irate right now.
10964,Michael,Give me the phone.
10965,Dwight,Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
10966,Michael,Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
10967,Dwight,I have to put you on with my boss.
10968,Jim,"Well, I should hope so.  Who is this?"
10969,Michael,"Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager."
10970,Jim,"Well, this is William M. Buttlicker."
10971,Michael,"Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?"
10972,Jim,"Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today."
10973,Michael," See how it's done?  Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it.  See what I did?"
10974,Dwight,You are the master.
10975,Jim,"There is one condition, Michael."
10976,Jim,You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
10977,Dwight,"Don't do it, Michael."
10978,Michael,...  It's a million-dollar sale.
10979,Andy,"So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful."
10980,Angela,I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
10981,Andy,Hobos live in trains.
10982,Angela,Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
10983,Andy,"Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now."
10984,Angela,"OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field"
10985,Angela,There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
10986,Andy,Do you have a specific place in mind?
10987,Angela,No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
10988,Jim,"OK, what are you --"
10989,Dwight,Shh.  They might be listening to us.
10990,Dwight,They might be listening to us
10991,Dwight,You never know. Better safe than sorry.
10992,Jim, What are you thinking?
10993,Dwight,Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
10994,Jim,"The mob, maybe NASA."
10995,Dwight,"Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that."
10996,Jim,Is there some evidence?
10997,Pam," Ooh, cute shoes online."
10998,Jim,How many shoes do you need?
10999,Dwight,"I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?"
11000,Jim,I'm not talking to you.
11001,Dwight,Who are you talking to?
11002,Dwight,"She's not here, Jim."
11003,Pam, Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
11004,Andy,"I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms."
11005,Dwight,Shh. Do you hear that?
11006,Dwight,Breathing. Is that you?
11007,Dwight,"Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. "
11008,Dwight, I think you know.
11009,Dwight,"What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?"
11010,Dwight,"Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself."
11011,Jim,Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
11012,Dwight,"The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved."
11013,Pam, That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
11014,Jim," Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way."
11015,Jim,"Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but..."
11016,Jim,"Hey, how are you and Darryl?"
11017,Pam,Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
11018,Pam,Did you do something to her?
11019,Jim,I don't think so.
11020,Ryan,Living in the moment.
11021,Jim,Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
11022,Ryan,"I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost.  Can I tell you what else I learned?"
11023,Jim,"Wait, that's pretty weird."
11024,Jim,"Well, Andy has a mug just like that."
11025,Ryan,"Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one."
11026,Ryan,Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer.  That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
11027,Jim,I wasn't. But thank you.  Do you know anything about this party?
11028,Pam,"Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead."
11029,Jim,"Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- "
11030,Jim,"Dwight, let me see your coffee cup."
11031,Jim,"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party."
11032,Dwight,"Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?"
11033,Dwight,Obviously. I knew it.
11034,Jim,That's what I'm saying.
11035,Dwight,I was -- I was right.
11036,Jim,"You knew it the whole time, buddy."
11037,Dwight,"I knew it the whole time, buddy! "
11038,Pam, Right Dwight is loud.
11039,Dwight,I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo!  Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
11040,Jim,"No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this."
11041,Michael,Why don't you tell us?
11042,Dwight,"Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit."
11043,Michael,Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
11044,Dwight,"Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake."
11045,Jim,"We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks."
11046,Michael,"You cannot say ""I was raped"" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened."
11047,Dwight,We have our confession. I'm calling security. 
11048,Michael,"Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people."
11049,Michael,"Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us."
11050,Dwight,I want to be here when you fire her ass.
11051,Michael,I will call you when it is time. 
11052,Michael,"I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?"
11053,Michael,I think you should do that. 
11054,Pam,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
11055,Jim,"Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?"
11056,Pam,"Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work."
11057,Jim,That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
11058,Jim,I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
11059,Pam,"Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too."
11060,Pam,I'll see you tomorrow.
11061,Dwight,Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth?  May I?
11062,Dwight,Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
11063,Andy,"We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers."
11064,Dwight,"Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? "
11065,Dwight," While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications.  I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal.  Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night."
11066,Dwight,"While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands."
11067,Andy,"Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! "
11068,Andy,"Um, what are we talking price wise?"
11069,Dwight,You already said deal.
11070,Angela,Pay him whatever he wants.
11071,Andy,Can't argue with that. Dwight ...  You are going to make us so happy. 
11072,Michael,Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.
11073,Jim,Why are you telling us this?
11074,Michael,I am jetting off on an international business trip.
11075,Jim,Where are you going?
11076,Michael,"My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery..."
11077,Michael,"Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi."
11078,Michael,I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.
11079,Jim,Six point five days. 
11080,Jim,Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
11081,Michael,I have my passport. 
11082,Michael,I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.
11083,Michael,Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
11084,Michael,"And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce."
11085,Michael,Well that is all in the past.
11086,Michael,They have one of those?
11087,Dwight,"Wait, why do you need three suitcases?"
11088,Michael,Two are for souvenirs.
11089,Dwight,Do you have your money belt?
11090,Michael,I do. It's right here. 
11091,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. "
11092,Michael,"No, I don't want to wear a bra."
11093,Dwight,"Here, let me help you. "
11094,Michael,Stop it! Stop it!
11095,Dwight,Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
11096,Michael,Okay. Where is my translator?
11097,Andy,I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. 
11098,Andy,Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
11099,Michael,Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you  if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?
11100,Michael,There we go. Our town car awaits.
11101,Michael,Its not just a van.
11102,Michael,"Dwight, can you get those please?"
11103,Michael, Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
11104,Michael,Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet.
11105,Andy,Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
11106,Michael,Take a sip of that. 
11107,Michael,Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar.
11108,Michael,You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
11109,Michael,"Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning."
11110,Michael,"Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums."
11111,Michael," Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies."
11112,Oscar, Andy brought one too.
11113,Andy, Harry and the Henderson's
11114,Michael,Shhhh! Keep it down.
11115,Oscar,I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? 
11116,Michael,"Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much."
11117,Michael,Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
11118,Michael,"Oh... okay.  Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a--  GAH!"
11119,Ryan, Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.
11120,Ryan,This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. 
11121,Michael, This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah.
11122,Oscar,I'll check us in.
11123,Andy,"We are going to find out where the action is, my friend."
11124,Michael,Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
11125,Andy,"Mmm... bingo!  Follow moi, bro-sieur."
11126,Andy, What about a nice sushi place? Maybe a place with a view?
11127,Michael,"Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!"
11128,Andy,One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
11129,Michael,"A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered."
11130,Pam, I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
11131,Jim,Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
11132,Pam,"I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers."
11133,Jim,"Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek."
11134,Pam,I have to stay and retake it.
11135,Jim, W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
11136,Pam,That means another twelve weeks.  Can you do this for another three months?
11137,Jim,"It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream."
11138,Jim,And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
11139,Pam," Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go."
11140,Michael,"Guys, she's in there."
11141,Oscar,I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
11142,Andy,Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
11143,Michael," Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again."
11144,Michael,"Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez."
11145,Oscar,Nice to meet you. 
11146,Michael,"Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie..."
11147,Michael,"...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight."
11148,Michael,"And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---"
11149,Michael,She's foreign. I am--
11150,Andy,For Madame et monsieur. 
11151,Andy,Let me get a picture of you guys.
11152,Michael,"Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with."
11153,Andy,"Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked."
11154,Oscar,How do you even know they're gay?
11155,Andy,Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there.  Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait.  Bad decision in a glass.
11156,Andy,"I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse."
11157,Andy,You'll thank me when they spank thee.
11158,Andy,Do you guys like apples?
11159,Andy,Do you like apples?
11160,Andy,"Well, how do you like these apples?  Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? "
11161,Andy,"No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right."
11162,Oscar,What are you doing?
11163,Andy,"Dude, you struck out. They're totally stuck up. Here... drink up."
11164,Michael,How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
11165,Michael,---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
11166,Oscar,If you don't mind me asking---
11167,Andy,Anything. You can ask me anything.
11168,Oscar,"Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time."
11169,Oscar,How could anyone stand that woman?
11170,Oscar,What do you see in her? Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
11171,Andy,What do I see in Angela?
11172,Oscar,I want to know.
11173,Andy,I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have s*x with her.
11174,Oscar,You haven't had s*x?
11175,Oscar,"Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?"
11176,Andy,"Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for."
11177,Oscar,"Andy, something is wrong with that woman."
11178,Andy,What is wrong with her?
11179,Oscar,I'd like to know. You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
11180,Andy,I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
11181,Oscar,"Do it! It's a--- Call her!  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy.  Andy, don't call her!"
11182,Andy,"Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing.  Shh..."
11183,Andy,What is wrong with you?
11184,Oscar,Why won't you do Andy?
11185,Andy,That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
11186,Andy,This is Andy Bernard!
11187,Angela,I know who this is!
11188,Andy,I wanna take you to s*x school.
11189,Dwight, Who is that monkey?
11190,Angela,We will discuss this later.
11191,Andy,We'll discuss it later naked. I want to see you naked.
11192,Michael, Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
11193,Jim, How does everyone know already?
11194,Dwight,"Oh, well, doesn't surprise me."
11195,Dwight,"Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions."
11196,Dwight,What? Are there two suns?
11197,Dwight,"Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy."
11198,Jim,I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
11199,Dwight,It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.
11200,Andy,That was fun last night.
11201,Andy,"You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada."
11202,Oscar,"Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up."
11203,Andy,You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. 
11204,Oscar,I can't believe we called her up. 
11205,Oscar,I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
11206,Oscar,You--- you call--- you called her.
11207,Andy,"That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God!"
11208,Oscar,"Good morning, Michael.  Are you ready for the meeting?"
11209,Michael,Slept like a baby.
11210,Ryan,This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
11211,Ryan,"Okay. You have to break up with Darryl. I already typed out a text message for you. All you have to do is press ""send""."
11212,Ryan,Has to be done. We'll press send together. 
11213,Ryan,I'd like to see him try. 
11214,Ryan,That's all he wrote?
11215,Ryan,Can I see it?
11216,Ryan,Didn't you two date for like a long time?
11217,Michael,"Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings. "
11218,Andy,"Oh man, she is so pissed. "
11219,Andy,She's taking us back to first base.
11220,Oscar,What is first base with Angela?
11221,Andy,I get to kiss her forehead.  I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
11222,Oscar,I had a good time too.
11223,Andy,Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
11224,Andy,You up for a chest bump?
11225,Andy,Bro hug?  Back to basics. I like it.
11226,Andy,I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me. And he's delightful! 
11227,Michael,"Yeah, we locked him up for two years."
11228,Michael,No. Actually the trip sucked.
11229,Michael,"The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip."
11230,Michael,"I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van."
11231,Michael,And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
11232,Michael,"It was not, it sucked."
11233,Michael,Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---
11234,Michael,That was a really good choice.
11235,Michael,"No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man."
11236,Michael,That was a really sucky thing to do.
11237,Michael,"Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect."
11238,Kevin,"You did it, man.  Day one. Congrats."
11239,Pam,"I'm coming back the wrong way.  It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it.  Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?"
11240,Pam,I missed you too. 
11241,Dwight,Good. I need you to make five copies of these. 
11242,Pam,I'm not going inside.
11243,Dwight,Alright. First thing in the morning then.
11244,Ryan,I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
11245,Angela,"Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?"
11246,Dwight,"Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie."
11247,Jim,So why did you come in here?
11248,Dwight,To socialize. And inform.
11249,Michael,"Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier."
11250,Michael,Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
11251,Jim,"Why is that, why is that weird?"
11252,Michael,She said she was going to give it to him right now. 
11253,Jim," She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other."
11254,Michael,"Yeah, they used to."
11255,Jim,Toby works here again.
11256,Michael,"Oh, can you imagine?"
11257,Michael,I don't know. What?
11258,Jim,"You should probably just meander back there; take a look. See if he's, see if he's back."
11259,Michael,"Hmmm, dare I?  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. "
11260,Michael,"NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!"
11261,Michael, Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No.
11262,Michael,"Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance."
11263,Michael,"Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David."
11264,Michael,"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened."
11265,Michael,I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
11266,Dwight,"Also, it's icky back there."
11267,Michael,That's true. People say it's icky.
11268,Michael,Is there no way we can get rid of him?
11269,Michael,I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.
11270,Pam," Oh, come on!  Do you see this? Disgusting."
11271,Andy,"So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?"
11272,Jim,"Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that."
11273,Andy,"Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle."
11274,Jim,That's really not cool.
11275,Kevin,"So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?"
11276,Jim,"Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right."
11277,Jim,"Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.  She's gonna love it. Right?"
11278,Jim,Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
11279,Andy,"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle? You're in for a spanking my friend. Myself and my lady? - no secrets."
11280,Jim,"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry?"
11281,Oscar," ""To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance. By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter. Sincerely, disappointed."""
11282,Andy,That is just obnoxious.
11283,Pam,"Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?"
11284,Oscar,"The note. So ""holier than thou""."
11285,Angela,"Hmm, I liked it."
11286,Pam,Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
11287,Andy,"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess."
11288,Pam,"Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich."
11289,Michael,"You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served.  Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again."
11290,Michael,You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.
11291,Michael,So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.
11292,Michael,"Nice beaches, pristine beaches?"
11293,Michael,Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?
11294,Michael,"I bet, for you."
11295,Michael," Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself."
11296,Michael,"Yeah, I am. I am."
11297,Michael,"I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them."
11298,Dwight,"Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment."
11299,Michael,"That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act."
11300,Dwight,I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.
11301,Michael,"Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started."
11302,Michael,What are you doing?
11303,Dwight, I am the bait.
11304,Dwight,Men find me desirable.
11305,Dwight,"Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt."
11306,Michael,You're the bait for Toby?
11307,Michael,"No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me."
11308,Dwight,Men find me desirable.
11309,Michael,"Yes, sure they do, Dwight."
11310,Pam,"When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that."
11311,Pam, Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
11312,Jim,"Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?"
11313,Pam,Are you inching away from me?
11314,Pam,Reach your arms out.
11315,Jim, I'm always this close.
11316,Michael,"Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please."
11317,Jim,"Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so..."
11318,Michael,"Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam."
11319,Pam,"What do you need, Michael?"
11320,Michael,"Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?"
11321,Michael,"Good.  N-no no no, don't."
11322,Pam,"""Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you."""
11323,Michael,"Pam. Pam, you gave me your word."
11324,Ryan, You did that for me?
11325,Ryan,Are you happy you did?
11326,Michael,"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?"
11327,Ryan,"Yeah, yeah I'll see them."
11328,Michael,Toby can I see those? Ooh.  What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
11329,Dwight,Those are fighting words.
11330,Michael,You mad? You mad at me?
11331,Dwight,I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
11332,Michael,"Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?"
11333,Michael,Huh? He might do it...
11334,Michael,I dare you to. Come on.
11335,Michael,What's the matter... haaaww!
11336,Dwight,"Hit him! Hit him, Chicken."
11337,Michael,"Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?"
11338,Dwight,"Ryan. Come on, man?"
11339,Michael,"No do it, do it. I dare you."
11340,Dwight,Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
11341,Michael,"Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon..."
11342,Dwight,Are you really not going to punch him?
11343,Michael,Son of a bitch.
11344,Ryan," You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man."
11345,Dwight,I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
11346,Michael, Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
11347,Dwight,There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
11348,Dwight," Frame him, for using drugs."
11349,Dwight,"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal."
11350,Michael,"I've never framed a man before, have you?"
11351,Dwight,Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
11352,Michael,Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
11353,Michael,"Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing?  Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something."
11354,Michael,"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some..."
11355,Michael,I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.
11356,Michael,"I'm not wearing a wire, so..."
11357,Michael,How much? How many pounds is it?
11358,Ryan,"Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation."
11359,Ryan,"I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess."
11360,Pam,"I know, can you believe it?"
11361,Ryan,"Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up."
11362,Pam,"I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?"
11363,Ryan,"Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse."
11364,Pam,How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
11365,Ryan,I--- I would find a way.
11366,Pam,"You've seen things cleaned before though, right?"
11367,Ryan,"I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh..."
11368,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot..."
11369,Dwight," Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson  and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon."
11370,Pam,I don't know anything about that.
11371,Dwight,"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office. "
11372,Michael,"Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on. "
11373,Dwight,"Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator."
11374,Dwight,"They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission."
11375,Michael,"Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding."
11376,Dwight,"Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson."
11377,Michael,"Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?"
11378,Michael,"No, no no no... No, no."
11379,Michael,"No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate."
11380,Michael,"No, no no no no."
11381,Michael,"God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!"
11382,Michael,Are you kidding me? That's my salad.
11383,Dwight,"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?"
11384,Dwight,"Gahh, dammit!  Come on!"
11385,Dwight,"Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?"
11386,Dwight, You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?
11387,Michael,You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
11388,Michael,Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
11389,Michael,"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face."
11390,Michael,You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...
11391,Michael,"Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history."
11392,Michael,Do you want to hear a lie?
11393,Michael,I think you're great. You're my best friend.
11394,Ryan, I can't do this.
11395,Ryan,It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.
11396,Ryan,That was your choice
11397,Ryan,"It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?"
11398,Ryan,"Let's be adults about this. Let's have s*x one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing."
11399,Jim," Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?"
11400,Pam, What are we doing at your parent's house?
11401,Jim,"I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now  open your eyes. Tadah!"
11402,Pam,I don't get it.
11403,Jim,"I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation.  Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... "
11404,Jim," So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect  for an art studio.  Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---"
11405,Pam,"Yeah, I love it!"
11406,Pam,"I mean, you bought me a house!"
11407,Pam,You bought me a house!
11408,Pam,"Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?"
11409,Jim,"No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about."
11410,Jim,"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him."
11411,Dwight,"What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier."
11412,Oscar,Here are our final actual costs for this year.
11413,Oscar,"As you can see, we did pretty well, so..."
11414,Michael,"Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old."
11415,Oscar,"Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis..."
11416,Oscar,You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
11417,Oscar,But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
11418,Michael,Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
11419,Oscar,Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
11420,Oscar,So you have an extra dollar.
11421,Oscar,"So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer..."
11422,Oscar,"And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand."
11423,Michael,So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
11424,Oscar,We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
11425,Oscar,"We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need."
11426,Michael,"Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you..."
11427,Michael,"Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  Can anybody guess?"
11428,Michael,"No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?"
11429,Oscar,"No, no, please. Please do not do this."
11430,Pam,"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year."
11431,Michael,So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
11432,Pam," Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good..."
11433,Oscar,"Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?"
11434,Pam,"Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands."
11435,Oscar,"Pam, you make more copies than anyone."
11436,Pam,Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
11437,Michael,"Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one."
11438,Michael,"Alright, so, teams forming."
11439,Michael,You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
11440,Pam,"I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this."
11441,Jim,"Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier."
11442,Jim,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything."
11443,Oscar,"So Michael, what do you think?"
11444,Jim,You have to make the decision.
11445,Michael,"Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end."
11446,Andy,"Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms..."
11447,Andy,"I mean, like, ""156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left."""
11448,Andy,"""Walk until you hear the beehive."""
11449,Dwight,How could it be more clear?
11450,Angela,I think Andy makes an excellent point.
11451,Angela,But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
11452,Dwight,"We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine."
11453,Angela,Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
11454,Dwight,"Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on."
11455,Andy,"Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?"
11456,Andy,"We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit."
11457,Pam,"So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing..."
11458,Pam,I really think you should reconsider.
11459,Jim,"Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier."
11460,Pam,But I really think you should reconsider.
11461,Jim,"Beesly, are you threatening me?"
11462,Pam,"Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you.  But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground .  All right."
11463,Dwight,This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
11464,Andy,"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?"
11465,Dwight,You're gonna need to be more specific.
11466,Angela,Manure. Get rid of it.
11467,Dwight,Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
11468,Angela,Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
11469,Dwight,"You wanna eat, don't you?"
11470,Andy,"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?"
11471,Andy,See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here.  ...Darn! Heh.
11472,Dwight,There's a hose out back.
11473,Pam,"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?"
11474,Pam,Well that never happened.
11475,Michael,I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
11476,Oscar,I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
11477,Michael,"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing."
11478,Jim,"Woah, you guys going to lunch?"
11479,Jim,Mind if I join?
11480,Michael,Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
11481,Michael,I have no idea.
11482,Pam,"So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on.  It is so on."
11483,Pam,"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?"
11484,Jim,"Michael, that is hilarious."
11485,Michael," Oh, is somebody making fun of me?"
11486,Oscar,"The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. "
11487,Jim,Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
11488,Pam,"That's cool.  Mm, good stuff. "
11489,Jim,You look really pretty.
11490,Pam,You got a second?
11491,Pam,"Oh, that must've been so fun."
11492,Michael,it was fun. We had a good time.
11493,Pam,"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?"
11494,Pam,"Yeah, is that a new tie?"
11495,Michael,"Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars."
11496,Michael,You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
11497,Michael,Nine dollars. The boys' department.
11498,Michael,Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
11499,Michael,Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
11500,Pam,"Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier."
11501,Pam,Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
11502,Michael,Sits on a copier.
11503,Pam,Or even uses the copier every day.
11504,Pam,"All right, see you later..."
11505,Dwight,Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
11506,Angela,No. I haven't thought of it.
11507,Dwight,"Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard."
11508,Angela,I would like cat.
11509,Dwight,Cats don't make butter.
11510,Angela,I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
11511,Dwight,It doesn't make any sense.
11512,Angela,I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
11513,Dwight,"Cow, goat or sheep."
11514,Andy,"What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it-  Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!"
11515,Jim," You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you."
11516,Pam,Yeah. I have my copies. 
11517,Pam,And I have my original. 
11518,Kevin,"Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay."
11519,Michael,"Oh, thank you my dear."
11520,Michael,"Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay..."
11521,Michael,"There he is! Hello, hello!"
11522,Michael,Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
11523,Michael,Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
11524,Pam,"Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!"
11525,Michael,"Oh... ah, I almost choked."
11526,Dwight,"So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here."
11527,Angela," Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-"
11528,Angela,I work with Dwight.
11529,Dwight,He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
11530,Dwight,"Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad...  And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, ""I do.""  And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply..."
11531,Dwight,"And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife."
11532,Pam,Did somebody call Hank?
11533,Michael,"Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads."
11534,Michael,"Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want."
11535,Michael,"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-"
11536,Michael,"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs."
11537,Pam,You can try mine.
11538,Michael,"Oh, there we go."
11539,Michael,"Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party."
11540,Michael,"Well, what should I do?"
11541,Michael,"All right, get out. Get out."
11542,Angela,"Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy."
11543,Dwight,I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
11544,Angela,What do you mean?
11545,Dwight,"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, ""I do."" And I said, ""I do."" And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness."
11546,Angela,Dwight! That doesn't count!
11547,Dwight,"Yes, of course it does."
11548,Dwight,It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
11549,Angela,We are not married.
11550,Dwight,My... It's not my fault you don't understand German
11551,Andy,"Are we, uh... are we leaving or what?  Ow!"
11552,Michael,Hey David-  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
11553,Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling-  I'm sorry."
11554,Michael,"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different."
11555,Michael,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy."
11556,Michael,...Like a tip?  $645?!
11557,Michael,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king."
11558,Jim," We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you."
11559,Michael,"All right, attention everyone."
11560,Jim,Let me call you right back. Okay.
11561,Michael,I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
11562,Michael,"Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  They don't have copiers. They don't even-  Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing."
11563,Michael,Do I know what?
11564,Oscar,I think you know.
11565,Oscar,Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
11566,Oscar,Why'd you say dollars?
11567,Michael,Because that is how my mind works.
11568,Oscar,"What's 15% of 200?  Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus."
11569,Pam,You can do that?
11570,Kevin,"Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?"
11571,Pam,You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
11572,Michael,"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less."
11573,Oscar,You're gonna get us a copier then?
11574,Michael,This is so stupid.
11575,Michael,"This is so, so stupid. And, God...  that's my phone."
11576,Michael,"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me."
11577,Andy,"Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you.  What-"
11578,Angela," Now, I have to take care of a legal issue."
11579,Andy,Was that hot or what?
11580,Pam,So what's it gonna be?
11581,Oscar,"Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done."
11582,Pam,"Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me."
11583,Oscar,You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
11584,Michael, You think it's easy?
11585,Michael,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?"
11586,Michael,"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just-  Hey."
11587,Oscar,"Hey, we're going with the chairs."
11588,Oscar,I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
11589,Michael,Good work. I'm proud of you.  Mother-
11590,Michael," What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three,  you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory."
11591,Pam,"Yeah, I guess, since I won."
11592,Jim,"Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.  Totally kidding.  I'm gonna need four. "
11593,Jim,"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas."
11594,Dwight,You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?
11595,Jim,Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
11596,Dwight,"Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid.  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes."
11597,Jim,I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
11598,Dwight,"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- "
11599,Michael,"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?"
11600,Michael,Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
11601,Angela,It's the nativity scene.
11602,Angela,I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
11603,Jim,Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
11604,Dwight,"These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil."
11605,Dwight,"Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catchphrase: ""My horn can pierce the sky"". Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess? "
11606,Jim,That's the Christmas spirit.
11607,Dwight,I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has s*x with a unicorn? Man with a horn has s*x with a royal horse?
11608,Michael,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out."
11609,Michael,Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.
11610,Michael,"This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything."
11611,Michael,Alright... One more time around the block.
11612,Jim,I will grant you one wish.
11613,Pam,I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
11614,Jim,Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.  Dumb.
11615,Andy," Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. "
11616,Angela,Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
11617,Andy, There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
11618,Michael,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
11619,Jim,"Wow, that is delicious."
11620,Jim,Can't believe no ones thought of that.
11621,Dwight,"Oh, so glad I could help."
11622,Michael," Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India."
11623,Jim," Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
11624,Dwight,We got a live one! On fire!! 
11625,Oscar,"We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?"
11626,Michael,"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth"
11627,Oscar,What about February 2nd?
11628,Jim,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
11629,Michael,"No, no. I celebrate privately."
11630,Michael,Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
11631,Oscar,Now? It's our Christmas party.
11632,Michael,We'll do it quickly.
11633,Jim,Well what if we can't do it quickly.
11634,Michael, What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
11635,Oscar,Do you know how to do an intervention?
11636,Michael,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up."
11637,Michael,"An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop."
11638,Michael,"Okay, how do you feel?"
11639,Kevin,Fire girl.  Too soon?
11640,Michael,"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party."
11641,Michael,I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
11642,Michael,"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. "
11643,Michael,The aye's have it.
11644,Michael,"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? "
11645,Andy,"When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B's. They called me Buzz."
11646,Michael,"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?"
11647,Michael,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
11648,Michael,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
11649,Oscar,Where did you get this?
11650,Michael,"I got it on a website, that's not important."
11651,Michael,"Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?"
11652,Michael,"Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  Yes, Kevin."
11653,Kevin,"Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool."
11654,Michael,That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
11655,Kevin,"Yeah, you said affected by it. Thanks again, Meredith."
11656,Michael,"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?"
11657,Dwight,"No, I like Meredith."
11658,Dwight,"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention.  Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching."
11659,Michael,Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
11660,Michael,"Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do."
11661,Michael,I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
11662,Michael,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you."
11663,Angela,Please stop making me do these things.
11664,Angela,But it's the season of mercy.
11665,Michael," Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?"
11666,Dwight,I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
11667,Dwight,"There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick."
11668,Michael,"Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out."
11669,Dwight,"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to."
11670,Dwight,She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
11671,Dwight,I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
11672,Jim,"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that."
11673,Dwight,"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks."
11674,Jim,"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us."
11675,Michael,"Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help."
11676,Michael,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice."
11677,Jim, They've been in there for 45 minutes.
11678,Pam,"I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. "
11679,Jim,Do you take requests?
11680,Jim,Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
11681,Michael, I'll be down in a minute.  Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
11682,Michael,"Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess."
11683,Michael,"We could go there, sure."
11684,Michael,I have a new place.
11685,Michael,"Yeah, oh there you go."
11686,Dwight,"Oh, that's my last one."
11687,Darryl,"All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400."
11688,Darryl,You can owe me.
11689,Darryl,"I know, right. Merry Christmas."
11690,Darryl,Something wrong with the doll?
11691,Michael,It's okay. It's all right.
11692,Michael,"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--"
11693,Michael,Here we go. This is gonna be good.
11694,Michael,Shhh... just calm down.
11695,Michael,Here's the door. Here's the door.
11696,Michael, Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
11697,Michael,I have a deposit. Alcoholic.
11698,Michael,So do I sign?
11699,Angela,"I'm not moving the tree. Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell. And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree."
11700,Dwight,Well don't look so surprised.
11701,Jim,You did not know it.
11702,Pam,I knew some of it.
11703,Jim,Everyone knew some of it.
11704,Pam,Thank you. I knew it.
11705,Michael,As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.
11706,Andy,"All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. "
11707,Angela,I think I'd like to go home now.
11708,Andy,"Sure. Dooo. Tough room.  Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night."
11709,Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?"
11710,Michael," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!"
11711,Pam,"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard."
11712,Michael,"No. No, no. There was wind."
11713,Dwight,I was just jogging.
11714,Michael,"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over."
11715,Jim,"No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead."
11716,Michael,I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
11717,Michael,I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
11718,Oscar,Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
11719,Michael,"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number."
11720,Michael,"Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by  Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad."
11721,Pam,"Quick announcement: new year, new candy."
11722,Pam,"Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy."
11723,Pam,"So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more..."
11724,Andy," Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just...  No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday."
11725,Michael,"Wait, you still don't know..."
11726,Michael,You still don't know.
11727,Michael, What are you doing?
11728,Jim,How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
11729,Andy,"No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you."
11730,Michael," No, what I'm saying is..."
11731,Michael,"No, that's not it."
11732,Jim,"Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward."
11733,Michael, How can he still not know?
11734,Jim,We can't figure that out.
11735,Michael,I can't take it anymore.
11736,Dwight,"Wait, what? You can't take what?"
11737,Michael,I am telling Andy.
11738,Dwight,No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
11739,Michael,"Who should it come from, then?"
11740,Michael, Are you still having intercourse with her? 
11741,Oscar,What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
11742,Michael,Did you ever have intercourse in this office? 
11743,Oscar,"Are you serious? Ugh. Where?  Where?  Where, Dwight?"
11744,Dwight, Seems like you already know where.
11745,Angela,"Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top."
11746,Kevin,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away."
11747,Kevin,"Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form...  What?"
11748,Oscar,"That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form."
11749,Kevin,"How about, ""I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?"""
11750,Andy," That cannot be true!  You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself..."
11751,Dwight, Trade seats with me.
11752,Dwight,I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
11753,Dwight, I need a soup spoon.
11754,Dwight,"Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five.  Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. "
11755,Dwight,You've got to tell Andy about us.
11756,Angela,That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
11757,Dwight,Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
11758,Angela,You're expanding on your worst idea.
11759,Dwight,Do you love me or not?
11760,Angela,I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
11761,Dwight,Because you're engaged to Andy.
11762,Andy,When what?  When what?
11763,Michael,You know this can't go on.
11764,Andy,What can't go on?
11765,Michael,We have to put an end to this.
11766,Andy,You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
11767,Jim,This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
11768,Dwight,Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
11769,Michael,When will she be ready?
11770,Michael,Is she crazy in bed?
11771,Jim,This shouldn't happen at work.
11772,Jim,This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
11773,Jim,"Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything."
11774,Michael,I am already walking.
11775,Dwight,"Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down."
11776,Michael,"Okay, what does that mean?"
11777,Michael," Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it."
11778,Dwight, Have a good trip.
11779,Michael,"Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear..."
11780,Andy,You're not making any sense.
11781,Michael,"Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day."
11782,Michael,Which will be fine. I am off!
11783,Andy,Have a good meeting!
11784,Michael," Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so..."
11785,Andy,I can't hear you through the glass
11786,Michael, Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
11787,Michael,All right. See you later.  Ahh.
11788,Oscar,You said that yesterday.
11789,Jim, What are you standing for?
11790,Dwight,"If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin."
11791,Jim,You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
11792,Dwight,"If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to."
11793,Jim,"Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit..."
11794,Andy, I need to talk to you.
11795,Angela,We can talk right here.
11796,Andy,I need to talk to you in private.
11797,Andy,Let's go to the conference room.
11798,Angela,What have you heard?
11799,Andy,That you're sleeping with Dwight.
11800,Angela,That doesn't sound like me.
11801,Angela,"Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake..."
11802,Andy,Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
11803,Andy,How long has it been going on?
11804,Angela,"I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again."
11805,Andy,Who else knows about it?
11806,Angela," Let me think about it... I, um... there... "
11807,Andy,Oh God. Come on!
11808,Michael,"David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever."
11809,Michael,"Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation."
11810,Michael,"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler."
11811,Michael," Hey, what say we order up some pasta?"
11812,Angela,"Standard, you know? Nothing fancy."
11813,Angela,I said nothing fancy.
11814,Andy,Do you love him?
11815,Andy,Why should I believe that?
11816,Angela,"Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together."
11817,Angela,"Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong."
11818,Andy,"No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time."
11819,Dwight,Oh good. She broke up with you.
11820,Andy,No. It's over between you two.
11821,Dwight,"Uh, no way. I am not giving up."
11822,Andy, She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
11823,Dwight," Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me."
11824,Dwight,Will never be her name.
11825,Andy,It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
11826,Dwight,I don't think so.
11827,Jim,"Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?"
11828,Andy,I'm telling you to back down.
11829,Dwight,And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
11830,Andy,Then I'll make you.
11831,Dwight,Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
11832,Andy,Through the use of force.
11833,Dwight,"That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest."
11834,Andy,I will fight you.
11835,Dwight,"Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela."
11836,Dwight,What is your weapon?
11837,Jim,"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because..."
11838,Dwight,"Hey, this is none of your business."
11839,Jim,Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
11840,Andy,Guess what? Not happening at work.
11841,Andy,We're gonna do it outside.
11842,Andy,None of your business.
11843,Dwight,None of your business then.  Good. So what weapon?
11844,Dwight,That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
11845,Andy,Then I'll get something too.
11846,Pam,"Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now."
11847,Angela, I will respect the results of the duel.
11848,Pam,Of course you will.
11849,Andy,I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.
11850,Dwight,I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
11851,Jim,"So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God."
11852,Dwight, How'd that get there?
11853,Michael,"So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, ""Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?"" And he looks at me and he says, ""Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket."" And I look back at him and I say, ""I feel the need!... The need for tweed."""
11854,Michael,"I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me."
11855,Dwight, Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
11856,Angela, I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
11857,Oscar,"Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show."
11858,Kevin,"Oh come on, man! Believe in something."
11859,Dwight,"Come on, coward! Where are you? Where...  ""From the desk of Andrew Bernard.""  A note. Pathetic. ""Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested."" True. ""The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly..."" "
11860,Oscar,The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
11861,Dwight," Alas, after much consideration and deliberation..."
11862,Dwight,Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
11863,Dwight,Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
11864,Dwight,Never!  Get out and face me like a man!
11865,Andy,I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
11866,Dwight,"You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her!  All you do is dress fancy and sing.  ""La la la la la la la la la la!"" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!"
11867,Andy,"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?"
11868,Jim,Dwight! Are your legs broken?
11869,Dwight,No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
11870,Jim,"Andy, are you all right?"
11871,Andy,"Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!"
11872,Dwight,"Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost?  Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! "
11873,Andy,"What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
11874,Andy,"What? You stupid idiot!  You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods..."
11875,Dwight,"Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!"
11876,Andy,I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
11877,Dwight,She's sleeping with you?
11878,Dwight,She said she was only sleeping with me.
11879,Andy," Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one."
11880,Michael,"Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!"
11881,Jim,Looks like a red wire.
11882,Dwight,Hmm. It wasn't here before.
11883,Jim,"Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires."
11884,Dwight,"No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires."
11885,Jim,"Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore. "
11886,Jim,"I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal.  Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there."
11887,Michael,"What you talking bout, Wallace? "
11888,Michael,"Hi, I am well, how are you?"
11889,Michael,"Oh, have you not?"
11890,Michael,"Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?"
11891,Michael,"Oh, well, then, email it to me."
11892,Andy,What are you guys talking about?
11893,Andy,Who is the gal in question?
11894,Pam,Have you seen her with her bangs?
11895,Kevin,She looks like a monster.
11896,Jim,"Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work."
11897,Kevin,That is not the question.
11898,Kevin,"Yeah, thank you Phyllis."
11899,Jim,"Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it."
11900,Jim," No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand.  Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. "
11901,Kevin, Five. Five to five.
11902,Jim,"Thank you, accounting department."
11903,Kevin,So what do we do now?
11904,Dwight, What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
11905,Michael,I will seduce her.
11906,Dwight,"No, I wanna seduce her."
11907,Michael,"No, I will seduce her."
11908,Michael,"No, I got it."
11909,Dwight,You'll fall in love with her.
11910,Michael,"Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support."
11911,Dwight,"Okay, let's go over the plan again."
11912,Michael,"Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies"
11913,Dwight,I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
11914,Dwight,Then we meet at the Denny's...
11915,Dwight,...and then we compare notes.
11916,Michael,"No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP."
11917,Dwight,You know how I feel about IHOP.
11918,Michael,You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
11919,Dwight,I'll have a cup of a coffee.
11920,Michael,You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
11921,Dwight,Store only has three employees.
11922,Dwight,It means they are not expanding.
11923,Michael,Maybe they are shrinking.
11924,Michael,They could be shrinking.
11925,Dwight,No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
11926,Dwight," Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch."
11927,Dwight,Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
11928,Michael,"And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business."
11929,Dwight,"Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus."
11930,Michael,"Argh, why are you all..."
11931,Dwight,Get your clouds right.
11932,Dwight,"So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it.  No, no like this.  Good."
11933,Michael,Ready to do this?
11934,Michael,Good. Here come the sharks. 
11935,Michael,"In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business."
11936,Michael,My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
11937,Michael,We are a law firm.
11938,Michael,"You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?"
11939,Michael,Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
11940,Michael,"Ah, so when did you set up shop?"
11941,Michael,"Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely ."
11942,Andy,Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.
11943,Kevin,The debate is whether she is hot.
11944,Kevin,"Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting."
11945,Michael,"So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?"
11946,Michael,Well that is... because... I am a genius.
11947,Michael,"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Is this the cup?  Is this what I drink out of?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession."
11948,Dwight,"Hello, I would like to apply for a job."
11949,Dwight,Why don't you just get rid of this guy? 
11950,Dwight,"I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?"
11951,Dwight,"Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business."
11952,Jim,"I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people."
11953,Kevin,"Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture."
11954,Kevin,"He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing."
11955,Jim,"Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you  and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot?  Does that end the debate?"
11956,Kevin," No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game."
11957,Dwight,"My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. "
11958,Michael,"Hey, hey, how is your interview going?"
11959,Dwight,It's going very well.
11960,Michael,"Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?"
11961,Michael,"I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great  Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left "
11962,Michael,"What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?"
11963,Michael,"Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?"
11964,Michael,Excellent! Way to go! Nice! 
11965,Kevin,"Ladies and gentlemen, even though the pen1s was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy."
11966,Angela,"Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker."
11967,Michael,"Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision."
11968,Michael,"I... Okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you. "
11969,Dwight," Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car."
11970,Michael,Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
11971,Dwight,Thank you very much.
11972,Michael,I cannot wait to contact your clients.
11973,Dwight,Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. 
11974,Michael,"Haha, we struck the mother load!"
11975,Michael,Wallace is going to freak.
11976,Dwight,All their top clients I can't believe it.
11977,Michael,He's going to absolutely freak.
11978,Dwight,"Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. "
11979,Dwight,You drove over that. Go back 
11980,Michael,"Oh God, what was that?"
11981,Michael,"No no, we are fine. You have done enough already."
11982,Dwight,You've done more then you can possibly know.
11983,Michael,"Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so..."
11984,Michael,"No, no, really not necessary."
11985,Dwight,He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
11986,Pam,"Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access."
11987,Oscar,"See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot."
11988,Dwight,How much longer is this going to take?
11989,Michael,You know let me give you some money for this.
11990,Michael,"Oh coffee, that's too much. "
11991,Dwight,"This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?"
11992,Dwight,I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
11993,Michael,"Ok, goodbye Prince Family."
11994,Dwight,"Goodbye prince family,  should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it.  Bye bye."
11995,Jim," I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying."
11996,Michael,"Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?"
11997,Dwight,"Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them."
11998,Michael,"Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine."
11999,Dwight,They could do better.
12000,Michael,"Why don't we just, live and let live?"
12001,Michael,Live and let live.
12002,Dwight,"I'm not familiar with that expression,"
12003,Michael,It's from James Bond.
12004,Dwight,"It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive."
12005,Michael,I'm not going to make this call.
12006,Dwight,"Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?"
12007,Dwight,"Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions."
12008,Michael,That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
12009,Dwight,"Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us."
12010,Dwight,"There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died."
12011,Michael,You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
12012,Dwight,"Good, so,  where are you going?"
12013,Michael,Just something I have to do first.
12014,Dwight,Where are you taking the client list?
12015,Michael,"Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone "
12016,Dwight,"Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. "
12017,Dwight,"Freeze, give me the list! "
12018,Dwight,"No no no, I can't let you do this!"
12019,Michael,Those people will be ruined. 
12020,Dwight,"Its business, not personal. "
12021,Michael,"Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people."
12022,Dwight,"Its over, Michael, its over. "
12023,Michael,Im not a shark.
12024,Andy,"Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot?  Okay. And all those opposed? "
12025,Oscar,"That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. "
12026,Dwight,"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?"
12027,Michael,I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
12028,Michael,"Oh, hey what is this?"
12029,Michael,"Oh, she is hot. "
12030,Dwight,"Last week I gave a fire safety talk.  And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  Today, smoking is gonna save lives. "
12031,Dwight, Does anyone smell anything smoky?
12032,Angela,Did you bring your jerky in again?
12033,Pam," Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!"
12034,Dwight,"Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?"
12035,Pam,The phones are dead.
12036,Dwight,"Oh, how did that happen?"
12037,Kevin,It's out in the hall.
12038,Dwight,"No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct."
12039,Michael,"Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm."
12040,Dwight,"What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?"
12041,Michael,"Everyone, now  calm down!"
12042,Dwight,"No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway."
12043,Michael,What does warm mean?
12044,Dwight,Not a viable option.
12045,Pam,Try a different door.
12046,Dwight,Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?
12047,Dwight,"Well, uh, another option. "
12048,Dwight,Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!
12049,Michael,"Get out of the way! Go, go, go!"
12050,Dwight,"Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can..."
12051,Oscar,Ah! My hand! That's hot!
12052,Andy,Aah! This ones hot too!
12053,Michael,"Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself."
12054,Andy,Get out of the way!
12055,Dwight,Have you ever seen a burn victim?
12056,Dwight,"Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?"
12057,Angela, It's okay. Shh shhh.
12058,Dwight,"A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people."
12059,Oscar,Stay alive! I'm getting help!
12060,Angela,I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit!  Oh!
12061,Dwight,How about 911? Anyone? 911. 
12062,Pam,What do we do?
12063,Dwight,Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
12064,Jim,"Okay, I am not dying here. Come on. "
12065,Angela,What is that? What is that?
12066,Andy,The fire's shooting at us!
12067,Andy,"Yes!  Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!"
12068,Andy,"Go, go, go, go, go!! "
12069,Dwight, Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.
12070,Dwight,"Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise.  So, what have we learned?  Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack."
12071,Michael,"No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth."
12072,Jim,"No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!"
12073,Michael,He's going to swallow is tongue.
12074,Michael,Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.
12075,Dwight,A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
12076,Dwight,"I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days."
12077,Dwight,"Yes I shouted ""fire!"". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--"
12078,Dwight,When no one hedded--
12079,Dwight,N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
12080,Dwight,"And, well, I don't see my co-workers--"
12081,Dwight,Hee-heeding this right now.
12082,Michael,"Okay.  This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed."
12083,Michael,Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.
12084,Michael,"I am not a mind reader, David."
12085,Michael,And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.
12086,Michael,You talking to me?
12087,Dwight,Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely.  It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
12088,Michael," No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands."
12089,Dwight,Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?
12090,Dwight,I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
12091,Michael,That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
12092,Michael,I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.
12093,Michael,"Nobody should have to go to work thinking, ""Oh, this is the place that I might die today."" That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true."
12094,Michael,"Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable.  Welcome back, Stanley."
12095,Andy, A throne for your highness.
12096,Michael,"No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet."
12097,Michael,"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means ""always be closing."""
12098,Dwight,This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
12099,Michael,Shut it. Shut it.
12100,Michael,"We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket."
12101,Kevin, I can't keep doing this forever.
12102,Dwight,Absolutely I would not.
12103,Michael,You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
12104,Michael,No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
12105,Michael,And you're okay with that?
12106,Michael,"Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this."
12107,Michael,Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!
12108,Michael,This is you we're talking about.
12109,Michael,"Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go.  Stanley. All right."
12110,Michael,"No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs."
12111,Michael,"Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?"
12112,Kevin,I would want to live with no legs.
12113,Michael,"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything."
12114,Michael,"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?"
12115,Jim,How's that gonna help you?
12116,Michael,I will divide and then count to it.
12117,Michael,"Yes, yes I do. I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified."
12118,Michael,"Okay, I got it."
12119,Michael,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive."
12120,Michael,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah..."
12121,Andy,"Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay,  you can look the other way. Loo do do!"
12122,Andy,"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da"
12123,Dwight,"Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?"
12124,Dwight,"Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest."
12125,Michael,He is an organ donor.
12126,Dwight,Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.  Here we go.
12127,Angela,Oh my God! Dwight!
12128,Angela,What are you--  What are you doing?
12129,Dwight,We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
12130,Dwight,"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic."
12131,Michael,Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
12132,Michael,"Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person."
12133,Andy,"Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn.  Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges."
12134,Pam,"We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people."
12135,Jim,And we don't know how.
12136,Pam,"But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him."
12137,Jim,Punishment fits the crime.
12138,Jim,"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage."
12139,Pam,My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
12140,Pam,He's not saying what he needs to say.
12141,Jim,"I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--"
12142,Andy,"Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head."
12143,Michael,"Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?"
12144,Dwight," ""I state my regret."""
12145,Jim,You couldn't of memorized that?
12146,Dwight,"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal."
12147,Dwight,"Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!"
12148,Pam,"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom."
12149,Andy,"I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite."
12150,Jim, Can you believe this?  He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
12151,Andy,"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?"
12152,Pam,So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
12153,Andy,"You guys, they're making out."
12154,Pam,"Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?"
12155,Jim,"Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal."
12156,Pam,"I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it."
12157,Pam,You're good to talk to.
12158,Jim," I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... "
12159,Michael, Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.  Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
12160,Michael,My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.  That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...
12161,Michael," It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance."
12162,Jim,Don't open your eyes.
12163,Michael,"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out."
12164,Michael,"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones."
12165,Michael,"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?"
12166,Michael,During our relaxation exercise?
12167,Michael,"No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go."
12168,Michael,"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay?  Let's give this a shot."
12169,Kevin,"Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out."
12170,Michael,So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
12171,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?"
12172,Pam,What did you say to my dad?
12173,Pam,"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment."
12174,Jim,"Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. "
12175,Jim,"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents..."
12176,Pam,What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
12177,Michael,I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
12178,Dwight,Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
12179,Michael,"Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge."
12180,Michael,"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short..."
12181,Michael,"What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other..."
12182,Oscar,Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
12183,Michael,"It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good."
12184,Kevin, Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
12185,Oscar,I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
12186,Michael,I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
12187,Dwight,"May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you."
12188,Dwight,That was the last signature I needed.
12189,Michael,"Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget."
12190,Angela,"If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. "
12191,Angela,I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. 
12192,Angela,If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
12193,Michael,"Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!"
12194,Michael,You're so lucky! Good one... 
12195,Michael," NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. "
12196,Jim,"Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary."
12197,Michael,I know where this is goin'.
12198,Jim,Ok. Remember Spider face?
12199,Jim,"OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface."
12200,Michael,Spite her - ok 
12201,Dwight,How dare you all attack him like this.
12202,Michael,"Oh, stop it Dwight."
12203,Dwight,Michael is your superior.
12204,Michael,No no no no no no!
12205,Dwight,"Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him."
12206,Michael,Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
12207,Dwight,"Ok, no, they don't understand who they have..."
12208,Michael,"That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot."
12209,Dwight,You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
12210,Michael,Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
12211,Dwight,Are you calling me an idiot?
12212,Dwight,"Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. "
12213,Pam,"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.  He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses."
12214,Michael,"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?"
12215,Pam,"Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.  If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! "
12216,Michael,"Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind."
12217,Darryl,"Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?"
12218,Michael,"We are, we are a family."
12219,Darryl,"Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there."
12220,Michael,Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
12221,Darryl,Roy left years ago. What's his name?
12222,Michael,I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
12223,Darryl,Nope. His name is Michael. 
12224,Andy," What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott."
12225,Michael,"Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.  Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.  So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought  sorry.  I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...  I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... "
12226,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks."
12227,Dwight,"It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them."
12228,Kevin, He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. 
12229,Oscar,Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
12230,Oscar,"That reeks, and I'm trying to eat."
12231,Dwight,Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
12232,Jim,Yep. You're being replaced.
12233,Pam,I think he meant personal day.
12234,Dwight,"Oh, that's quite a leap Pam."
12235,Jim,He just sent a text...
12236,Michael, Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
12237,Michael,"You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.  I'm okay. No, I'm not."
12238,Pam,Phyllis there's a package for you.
12239,Pam,"Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then."
12240,Jim,So what did he say? Was it my fault?
12241,Pam,"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best."
12242,Pam,When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. 
12243,Andy,"I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad."
12244,Pam,Michael! It's really good to see you.
12245,Dwight,Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
12246,Oscar,"Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. "
12247,Michael,"I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people."
12248,Michael,"Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela?  Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during s*x and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are...  Oscar, you're gay."
12249,Michael,"Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.  Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. "
12250,Michael,"They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case."
12251,Jim,"This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left."
12252,Michael," This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.  I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.  Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it."
12253,Michael,Could I stick it with a pin?
12254,Michael," Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine."
12255,Michael,"You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert."
12256,Jim,"That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh..."
12257,Jim,"What the heck? Is that, uh... "
12258,Jim,"I didn't, I'll look somewhere else."
12259,Michael,Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
12260,Michael,"You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles."
12261,Michael,"Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.  No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.  Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy."
12262,Pam,He brought a sled.
12263,Michael,"No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie."
12264,Pam,"Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks."
12265,Michael,"Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night."
12266,Michael,Well that goes without saying.
12267,Pam,I'm going to say it anyway.
12268,Michael,"Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's..."
12269,Pam,This is a new cardigan.
12270,Michael,...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
12271,Michael,"No. Oh, all right."
12272,Dwight,"Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior."
12273,Jim,Whoa! What was that all about.
12274,Dwight,"Go ahead, you do it."
12275,Jim,"Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama."
12276,Dwight,What he said was... 
12277,Dwight,"...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads."
12278,Jim,Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
12279,Dwight," I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating.  That's on my side."
12280,Jim,So this is fun.
12281,Pam,Can I turn on the radio?
12282,Michael,No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
12283,Pam,But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
12284,Michael,"Then listen to your iPod, Pam."
12285,Michael,Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
12286,Pam,That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
12287,Michael,"You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so..."
12288,Pam,"No, that was a long time ago."
12289,Michael,Is that why your wearing makeup today?
12290,Pam,"No, I'm not even wearing that much."
12291,Pam,"I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so..."
12292,Andy,"Um Phyllis, who's that?"
12293,Andy,"For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women."
12294,Andy,This conversation is over.
12295,Andy,"I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win."
12296,Jim,We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
12297,Dwight,If you say screw you one more time...
12298,Jim, Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
12299,Dwight,What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
12300,Pam," Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin."
12301,Michael,"Hello, Rolando, how are you?"
12302,Michael,"Rolando,  I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime."
12303,Michael,"Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked."
12304,Michael,"That's what I do, steal my trick."
12305,Pam,Please cut it out.
12306,Michael, Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
12307,Michael,"Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had s*x, and..."
12308,Michael,"Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?"
12309,Dwight,"Well, I'm not done yet."
12310,Jim,"Dwight. This,  fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?"
12311,Dwight,They match the carpet
12312,Jim,What is that?  It is your birthday period.
12313,Dwight,It's a statement of fact.
12314,Jim,Not even an exclamation point?
12315,Dwight,This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
12316,Jim,I can't believe how bad this looks.
12317,Dwight,"Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's."
12318,Dwight,Have you collected the money from everyone?
12319,Jim,I am working on it.
12320,Dwight,How much do you have?
12321,Dwight, That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
12322,Jim,I said I was working on it.
12323,Andy," Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes!  Whoa! Aah, Aah! "
12324,Michael," NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you...  This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't.  Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?"
12325,Michael,"I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died."
12326,Michael,Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? 
12327,Michael,"I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it."
12328,Michael,"I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. ""M"" your name is Mark."
12329,Michael,Got it. It works.
12330,Michael,But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
12331,Michael,"Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try."
12332,Michael,"Oh, I still have more."
12333,Michael,"She is pregnant. She is knocked up. ""K"" Karen. Pam, let's go."
12334,Andy,"Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there?  One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather..."
12335,Andy,"Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes."
12336,Andy,"Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her."
12337,Andy,"We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down."
12338,Andy,Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
12339,Michael,"I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, ""Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."""
12340,Michael,"No, don't worry, the chain is off."
12341,Michael,"Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it."
12342,Pam,So when are you due?
12343,Pam,"Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations."
12344,Michael,"It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?"
12345,Pam,What is happening there? 
12346,Michael,"No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time."
12347,Pam,"Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged."
12348,Michael,Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
12349,Andy,"So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?"
12350,Andy,"Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?"
12351,Andy," Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird."
12352,Andy,"Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking."
12353,Oscar," Oh, my desk is over... "
12354,Andy,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up."
12355,Andy,"Okay, it sounds risky."
12356,Michael,"I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean."
12357,Michael,"Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think."
12358,Pam,"I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came."
12359,Pam,"Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good."
12360,Andy,"Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so..."
12361,Andy,I am about to die.  Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
12362,Andy,"Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee."
12363,Andy, This is the Nard-Dog.
12364,Andy,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty."
12365,Andy,"Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?"
12366,Andy,"Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk."
12367,Andy, Sorry I tried to kiss y...
12368,Andy,We lost the account.
12369,Dwight, Damn it!  Dwight Schrute.
12370,Jim,It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
12371,Dwight,Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
12372,Jim,"Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?"
12373,Jim,Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
12374,Dwight, I'll call you back. 
12375,Dwight,"I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share.  ""Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center."" Juvie. ""According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..."" Blah, Blah, Blah. "
12376,Michael,"No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?"
12377,Michael,"Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small."
12378,Pam,"Perfect boobs,  of course I remember Holly."
12379,Michael,"She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that."
12380,Michael, I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
12381,Pam,"Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this."
12382,Jim, So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
12383,Michael,"I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success."
12384,Michael,"I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy."
12385,Michael, And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
12386,Pam,"Oh, wow, thank you!"
12387,Michael,You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
12388,Pam,"... Okay, let's go."
12389,Kevin,I didn't eat lunch.  I didn't eat all my lunch.
12390,Angela," Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good."
12391,Oscar,"Angela, you're more chipper than usual."
12392,Angela,"I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family.  She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive."
12393,Oscar,Where'd you get that kind of money?
12394,Angela,I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
12395,Kevin,"Wait, you didn't give it back?"
12396,Angela,He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
12397,Angela,I have something better than a picture. Come on.
12398,Oscar,You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
12399,Angela,"Yeah.  I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year."
12400,Angela,Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
12401,Kevin,"Any cat, you mean."
12402,Pam,"So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh!   I've been driving too long."
12403,Dwight, What did you do?
12404,Dwight,What did you do?
12405,Dwight,"What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?"
12406,Jim,Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
12407,Dwight,Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
12408,Dwight,Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
12409,Dwight,What did you do? Huh?
12410,Jim,"Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy."
12411,Dwight,"Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law.  What did you do?"
12412,Dwight,I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
12413,Jim,"Hey, you know what? I got you a cake."
12414,Jim,How do you hate it? It's a cake.
12415,Jim,"I forgot if there was an ""e"" between the ""l"" and the ""y."" I still don't know."
12416,Dwight,"Nice job on the cake, Bozo!"
12417,Jim,"Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl."
12418,Pam," Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah."
12419,Michael,Do I look okay?
12420,Michael,"Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch."
12421,Michael,"Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?"
12422,Michael,Oh- She's not here?
12423,Michael,She has a boyfriend.
12424,Pam,"I'm so sorry, Michael."
12425,Michael,"How could she do this to me, Pam?"
12426,Pam,She's not doing it to hurt you.
12427,Michael,"I can't do the presentation, I can't-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! "
12428,Pam,"Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-"
12429,Michael,"I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? "
12430,Pam,"You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing."
12431,Michael,And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
12432,Pam,Maybe. One step at a time.
12433,Pam,You can do this.
12434,Michael,I can do this.
12435,Oscar,"It could be snacks, or-"
12436,Kevin,Is that what I think it is? 
12437,Kevin,That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
12438,Angela,"Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed."
12439,Angela,"No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats.  I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!"
12440,Kevin,"Oh, the other one's watching."
12441,Jim,"Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake."
12442,Jim,"Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?"
12443,Dwight,"Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face."
12444,Jim,You know what? I could use a little help.
12445,Dwight,You know what? I'm a little busy.
12446,Jim,"We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?"
12447,Dwight,It's not effeminate. It's festive.
12448,Jim,"You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!"
12449,Michael,"Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper"" and get them to ""Show us the money!"" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen.  Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?"
12450,Michael,A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
12451,Michael,What do you race cars?
12452,Michael,"Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?"
12453,Michael,"Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?"
12454,Michael,Huh-  Does she ever talk about me? 
12455,Michael,It's all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
12456,Michael, Does it feel good?
12457,Michael," Your life.  Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue.  Oh, wow.  Ooh, okay."
12458,Pam,"Michael, get off the floor!"
12459,Michael,"Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards."
12460,Pam," No, no, no, you have to do it-"
12461,Michael,"No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.  Okay... okay."
12462,Pam,"That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.  I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump."
12463,Pam," Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw!  Cutting down the competition."
12464,Angela," Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now."
12465,Kevin,This is getting weird.
12466,Oscar,Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? 
12467,Angela,  Has this been on the entire time?
12468,Oscar,I have no idea.
12469,Kevin,I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
12470,Angela," Well, sorry I'm late. "
12471,Oscar,"I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball."
12472,Pam, Don't look up. Don't look up. 
12473,Michael,I went through Holly's things.
12474,Michael,I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
12475,Michael,"I also stole something off of her computer. A document called ""Dear Michael."""
12476,Michael,I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
12477,Pam,She never sent it to you?
12478,Michael,"No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it."
12479,Pam,"No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust."
12480,Pam,"Because, she didn't send it to you!"
12481,Michael,"I know, I know. You're right, you're right."
12482,Pam,I could read it.
12483,Pam,"Yeah, I could read it."
12484,Michael,"No, you don't have to do that."
12485,Pam,Go get your laptop.
12486,Pam, What? I'm not in love with her.
12487,Dwight," You have to write my suggestions down, too."
12488,Jim,"I'm not writing, ""Horse Hunt."" I don't even know what that means."
12489,Dwight,It's in the name.
12490,Jim," Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting."
12491,Dwight,"You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid."
12492,Jim,"Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?"
12493,Dwight,"Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. "
12494,Jim,"Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one."
12495,Dwight,"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year.  What about you?"
12496,Jim,"Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome."
12497,Dwight,"That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed."
12498,Jim, Didn't see that one coming.
12499,Pam,She still has feelings for you.
12500,Michael,She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
12501,Pam,"I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over."
12502,Dwight,"Hey, it's not a surprise."
12503,Jim,"What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?"
12504,Jim,"You haven't heard our theme, though."
12505,Jim,"That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television."
12506,Dwight,"Our theme, if you will."
12507,Jim,"Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping."
12508,Dwight," Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?"
12509,Kevin,Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
12510,Kevin,"Oh, then pick TV."
12511,Kevin,"No, watching TV at work is really cool."
12512,Dwight,"Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go."
12513,Dwight,"Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this."
12514,Jim,"Ahem. This is for you... and  ...Happy Birthday, Kel."
12515,Dwight," Okay, you've got one hour. "
12516,Dwight, Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap.  Many happy returns. 
12517,Michael,I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
12518,Pam,"No, we don't need to do that."
12519,Michael,"Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!"
12520,Michael,"Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!"
12521,Michael,"Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty."
12522,Pam,"Good morning, can I help you?"
12523,Pam,"I'm sorry, he's not in right now."
12524,Pam,"They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job. But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone.  Vending machine."
12525,Pam,That is a great idea.
12526,Pam," Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really..."
12527,Jim," Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya?"
12528,Jim,"Nice to meet you, yeah. Whew! I can assure you we don't need a new system though. Happy with ours."
12529,Michael," Hello, may I help you?"
12530,Michael,That was funny. Let's go do it to somebody else. Ayyyy!
12531,Michael,"Oh, look at that. Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year. You doin OK, bud?"
12532,Michael,"Yeah, I hear ya. It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting..."
12533,Kevin,I can't even imagine.
12534,Pam,This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
12535,Jim,"You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but."
12536,Pam,"Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday?"
12537,Michael,"Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here.  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall. "
12538,Michael,"Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces."
12539,Michael,"Pam, really, they're back?"
12540,Pam,I can't see them when they're on the floor
12541,Jim,"They're for her to look at, Michael."
12542,Michael,"Can I have a word with you, Jim?"
12543,Jim,"Yes, let's have a word."
12544,Michael,"Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office."
12545,Michael,"Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment."
12546,Dwight,So sexy it becomes hostile.
12547,Jim,"Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key."
12548,Michael,"Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--"
12549,Michael,--that none of us can be a part of--
12550,Pam,"You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael."
12551,Michael," --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party."
12552,Michael,"So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only."
12553,Dwight,"Yeah, deal with it Pam!"
12554,Michael,"So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other."
12555,Dwight,Having trouble finding a vein?
12556,Dwight,"I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my pen1s up into itself. "
12557,Michael,"I am about to give blood. The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --"
12558,Michael,"Oh, well, that's fine."
12559,Michael,"Yeah, can I point something out to you?"
12560,Michael,You're actually talking a lot.
12561,Michael,"Okay, here we go."
12562,Michael,"Yup, I'm good, whew. Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch."
12563,Pam,What do you think?
12564,Jim,I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
12565,Michael,I looked at the bag.
12566,Michael,I looked straight at the bag.
12567,Michael,"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?"
12568,Michael,That is full of soup.
12569,Michael,"Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. "
12570,Michael," Oh my God, how long was I out? "
12571,Michael,"Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?"
12572,Michael,"OK. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers. This is hers, she left her glove. I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove."
12573,Pam,Anything to get out of that office.
12574,Jim,"Oh yeah, I understood."
12575,Michael,"Well here we all are. Alone but together. No flowers for us.  Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships. I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan? He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?"
12576,Michael,"Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random s*x.  Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar."
12577,Oscar,I don't think so.
12578,Michael,"Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest."
12579,Michael,"If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else?"
12580,Jim,"No way, a 280?"
12581,Jim,"No. Bob, no. No!"
12582,Pam,Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
12583,Jim,"That is a lie, that is a lie."
12584,Pam,"Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back."
12585,Jim,But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
12586,Pam,"No, you just have little dainty fingers."
12587,Oscar,Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
12588,Angela,"Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but..."
12589,Oscar,"I was stupid, I told him."
12590,Kevin,Was he in to you in like a gay way?
12591,Michael,"Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story."
12592,Oscar,He told me he wasn't gay. 
12593,Oscar,I'm not done yet.
12594,Kevin,"A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says ""I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City."" "
12595,Michael,"Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!"
12596,Angela,My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
12597,Oscar,"Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here."
12598,Angela,"No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David."
12599,Oscar,"Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?"
12600,Angela,I guess I have. Huh.
12601,Michael,Alright who's next? Where's Andy?
12602,Oscar,He's on one of his honeymoons.
12603,Oscar,"He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage."
12604,Kevin,"My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said ""Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!"" and she said that we're done."
12605,Michael,You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
12606,Dwight,"You're right. OK everyone, back to work."
12607,Michael,"No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together."
12608,Dwight,A net? a giant net?
12609,Michael,No. Not a giant net.
12610,Dwight,What do you have in mind?
12611,Michael,I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
12612,Dwight,"Oh God, that's a terrible idea."
12613,Michael,Old fashioned meet market --
12614,Michael,-- I don't think it is.
12615,Dwight,"Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt."
12616,Michael,"These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say ""I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow."" Funny little bird, but he gets the job done."
12617,Dwight,"Eh, its not that early."
12618,Michael, So how you holding up?
12619,Dwight,I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
12620,Michael,"No. No, I meant about being single today."
12621,Michael,"Oh, here we go."
12622,Dwight,"Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend?  Hi, Dwight."
12623,Michael,"Babe alert!  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig."
12624,Michael,"Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self."
12625,Michael," So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  Where you from?"
12626,Michael,"Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better."
12627,Dwight,"I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead."
12628,Dwight,"You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today."
12629,Dwight,You must use a lot of paper.
12630,Pam,What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
12631,Jim,I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
12632,Pam,"Oh, damn.  They've been in there for like ten minutes."
12633,Jim,Look at that. Bob ordered hot food.
12634,Pam,Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries.
12635,Jim,We should help him out. 
12636,Kevin,At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool.
12637,Kevin,"I used to go there with my fiance . Before she left me . No, I mean, before I left her . She left me. "
12638,Kevin,I think I blew it. It all happened so fast. So... fast.
12639,Michael,"So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair."
12640,Michael,"Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair. Alright, I'll let you guys talk."
12641,Michael,"It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.  Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so  it's not too late."
12642,Dwight,"...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?"
12643,Dwight,Is somebody after you?
12644,Oscar,Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
12645,Dwight,"Hey, it just takes one!"
12646,Michael,"Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by."
12647,Michael,"It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her."
12648,Dwight,"Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up."
12649,Michael,"Believe me its nothing. I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched."
12650,Jim,"No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough."
12651,Pam,"Well, you should cover it with the broccoli."
12652,Jim,"Oh great, I have to cover?"
12653,Pam,Do you think they dined and dashed?
12654,Jim,"Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed."
12655,Pam,I thought we were having a nice time.
12656,Jim,Oh initially I did.
12657,Kevin,"Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is."
12658,Kevin,Are you on email?
12659,Dwight,"So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you."
12660,Dwight,"Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign--"
12661,Dwight,"OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God!"
12662,Michael,"Hey, you don't deserve her."
12663,Michael,"Hey, if anybody wants to go..."
12664,Oscar,We can stay a little longer.
12665,Michael,"You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit."
12666,Oscar,"Come on, we'll all go."
12667,Michael,"Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good."
12668,Pam," Yeah, that's no problem."
12669,Pam,I'm on the phone.
12670,Michael,"I know you are. Knock, knock."
12671,Pam," You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--"
12672,Pam,"0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye.  It really makes us look unprofessional."
12673,Michael,"They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. "
12674,Michael," Buddha this bread for me, won't you? "
12675,Michael,"I, I need something to wipe my hand."
12676,Pam,"Now there's, there's butter on my desk."
12677,Michael,That was helping. It was classic.
12678,Dwight,I got a knock-knock joke.
12679,Dwight,"OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me."
12680,Dwight, We will ask the questions!
12681,Michael,What the hell was that? 
12682,Dwight,What are you doing?
12683,Michael,What are you doing?
12684,Dwight,Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
12685,Michael,"You, you like that?"
12686,Dwight,C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
12687,Michael,Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
12688,Michael,"Dwight, get the door."
12689,Dwight,I'm not answering it.
12690,Dwight,"No way, it's the KGB."
12691,Dwight,I'm not answering that. You answer it.
12692,Michael,I'm not gonna answer it
12693,Dwight,"I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. "
12694,Jim,The KGB will wait for no one! 
12695,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa."
12696,Pam,"Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages."
12697,Michael,"Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!"
12698,Michael,"No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!"
12699,Michael,"The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy."
12700,Michael,"I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.  Umm hmm."
12701,Jim,We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
12702,Michael,Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
12703,Michael,No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
12704,Andy,"Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this..."
12705,Michael,"No, you don't. No, it -  What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?"
12706,Kevin,I think I should call her.
12707,Kevin,Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
12708,Andy," You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'"
12709,Kevin,But I do like her just the way she is.
12710,Andy,Well that's not what we agreed on.
12711,Jim,What are you doing?
12712,Jim," Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know."
12713,Pam,"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out."
12714,Andy,You're asking him to give up all of his power.
12715,Kevin,"Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker."
12716,Andy,"You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'"
12717,Pam,That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
12718,Jim,Well guys with girlfriends don't.
12719,Jim," Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket.  One of my clients found a golden ticket.   Yup. No, congratulations. "
12720,Jim, I'll take that down right now.
12721,Jim,I'm on the phone.
12722,Michael,...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
12723,Jim, Hold on one second.
12724,Michael,Invite them on the tour.
12725,Jim, It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
12726,Michael,"Really? That's kind of a big client.  Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?"
12727,Oscar,They're our largest client.
12728,Jim," Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't."
12729,Jim,How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
12730,Michael,I thought I did. So...
12731,Michael,Well no harm no foul.
12732,Jim,...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
12733,Michael,"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good."
12734,Michael,Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
12735,Michael,Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
12736,Darryl,Were the boxes near each other?
12737,Darryl,I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
12738,Michael,"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?"
12739,Michael,My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.  That... 
12740,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David.  No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial."
12741,Pam,"When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one."
12742,Michael,"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?"
12743,Michael,"Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about."
12744,Oscar,"Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?"
12745,Michael,"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -"
12746,Jim,"So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too."
12747,Michael,"Thank you, Jim is with me."
12748,Jim,"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you."
12749,Michael,Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
12750,Michael,"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes."
12751,Pam,Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? 
12752,Michael,"OK, don't get that. Please? "
12753,Michael,That is not constructive.
12754,Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet."
12755,Michael," Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--"
12756,Michael,How are you doing?
12757,Michael, My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
12758,Michael,"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know."
12759,Michael,I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
12760,Michael,"OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant."
12761,Michael," Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea."
12762,Dwight,That was your idea.
12763,Michael,"Woah, wow, who told you that?"
12764,Dwight,You did. Several times. Over and over again.
12765,Michael," No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight."
12766,Dwight, You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
12767,Michael,I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
12768,Dwight,Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
12769,Michael,"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary."
12770,Dwight,You don't keep a diary.
12771,Michael,Yes I do. You've just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
12772,Dwight,Hold that thought.   March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
12773,Michael,Why do you have a diary?
12774,Dwight,To keep secrets from my computer.
12775,Michael,"OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up."
12776,Dwight,"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math."
12777,Michael,What are you writing? 
12778,Dwight,Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
12779,Michael,Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
12780,Dwight,With all my heart.
12781,Kevin,You guys are throwing a lot at me.
12782,Jim,"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance."
12783,Pam,I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
12784,Jim,"No, that is what I mean."
12785,Pam," Shush.  Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic."
12786,Andy,Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
12787,Andy, ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
12788,Michael,We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
12789,Dwight,"OK, what am I thinking right now?"
12790,Dwight,No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
12791,Michael,"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me."
12792,Dwight,"Oh, not gonna happen."
12793,Dwight,I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
12794,Michael,"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly."
12795,Dwight,What about Shoe La La?
12796,Michael, It's not ready yet.
12797,Michael,"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house."
12798,Michael,"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight."
12799,Michael,"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information."
12800,Dwight,I love working here and I do not want to leave.
12801,Michael,He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
12802,Michael,"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion..."
12803,Dwight,We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
12804,Dwight,No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
12805,Michael,That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
12806,Michael,That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
12807,Dwight,I haven't made a decision yet.
12808,Michael,You kind of have.
12809,Jim,You cannot take the fall for him.
12810,Dwight,He said he would do the same for me.
12811,Jim,He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
12812,Dwight,I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
12813,Michael," Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do?  What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight?  Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation."
12814,Michael,"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?"
12815,Dwight,That's what she said! 
12816,Michael,"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?"
12817,Michael,Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
12818,Dwight, You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
12819,Michael,Give me the details of how that happened.
12820,Jim,"You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years."
12821,Jim,And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
12822,Pam," Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight."
12823,Dwight, 'Cause I've got this idea...
12824,Michael,Could I be a part of the meeting also?
12825,Jim,"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. "
12826,Dwight,"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka."
12827,Dwight,So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea .
12828,Michael,There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
12829,Pam,It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
12830,Michael,I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
12831,Dwight,That is my idea.
12832,Michael,"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?"
12833,Dwight,It is my idea.
12834,Michael,Oh how dare you.
12835,Dwight,It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
12836,Michael,"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?"
12837,Dwight,A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
12838,Michael,Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
12839,Dwight,Oh give me a break.
12840,Michael,"...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas."
12841,Dwight,That's because they're easy!
12842,Michael,They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
12843,Dwight,"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death."
12844,Michael,"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame."
12845,Michael,When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
12846,Dwight,Oh I am. In my own words.
12847,Michael,I want to see it.
12848,Michael,I want to see it. 
12849,Michael,Give me... Give me the diary.
12850,Kevin,"Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking."
12851,Kevin,I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
12852,Andy,"Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!"
12853,Jim,"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second."
12854,Dwight," When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?"
12855,Jim,"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine."
12856,Dwight,We have more houses to visit.
12857,Jim,"If you want to come back then, that'll be fine."
12858,Dwight,We will come back at... how is  4:45?
12859,Jim,I get back from work around 6.
12860,Jim,"You can try. That, that might work."
12861,Dwight,"Very well, we will come back at 5:15."
12862,Dwight,"Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause."
12863,Dwight,Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
12864,Jim, I don't know. Is it classy enough?
12865,Dwight,"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?"
12866,Jim,"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember."
12867,Michael,"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here."
12868,Jim,"And of course, classy."
12869,Dwight,"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?"
12870,Jim,"Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously."
12871,Dwight,"Oh, here's one: a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. "
12872,Michael," You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership."
12873,Jim,That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
12874,Dwight,Mr. Peanut is not classy.
12875,Dwight,"He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat."
12876,Michael,That's what makes him classy.
12877,Dwight,"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries."
12878,Jim,"Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind."
12879,Dwight,"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then."
12880,Jim,"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head: an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits."
12881,Michael,Not classy at all.
12882,Pam,"Hi, can I help you?"
12883,Pam,Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
12884,Pam,"Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you."
12885,Michael,Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
12886,Pam,"Yeah, are you coming out now?"
12887,Michael,"Uh-huh.  Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.  At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.  Here he is."
12888,Michael,"Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish."
12889,Jim,Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
12890,Michael,"What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous."
12891,Jim,"Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-"
12892,Michael,"You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish."
12893,Dwight,"Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities."
12894,Michael,"Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!"
12895,Dwight,"We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is..."
12896,Michael,"Surprise!  As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles."
12897,Michael,Took me all night.
12898,Pam,This is what you did last night?
12899,Michael,"I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.  It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental."
12900,Angela,"Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . ."
12901,Jim,"Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know."
12902,Jim,"I didn't think you'd notice.  Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him."
12903,Jim,"Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh."
12904,Jim,"Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... "
12905,Pam,He just had to wear his tux today.
12906,Jim,I thought it'd be funny.
12907,Pam,Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
12908,Michael,"All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department."
12909,Michael,"This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that."
12910,Michael,"This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange "
12911,Michael,There you go! Where's the other?
12912,Michael,"Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history."
12913,Michael,"Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. "
12914,Oscar,Do you have specifics?
12915,Michael,"Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people."
12916,Michael,Charles is going to tell you.
12917,Michael,"Well, it's not official."
12918,Michael,"Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance."
12919,Dwight,What about your party?
12920,Michael,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work."
12921,Michael,"Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet."
12922,Michael,I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
12923,Michael," David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed."
12924,Michael,It was my understanding.
12925,Michael,"Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability."
12926,Michael,But the branch is still mine?
12927,Dwight,Ask him about the party.
12928,Michael,"Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?"
12929,Dwight,No the other thing.
12930,Michael,"Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? "
12931,Michael,"I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before."
12932,Michael,Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
12933,Michael,"Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names."
12934,Michael,You're not from paper?
12935,Michael,Does David know this?
12936,Michael,"Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-"
12937,Michael,"And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?"
12938,Michael,"Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back."
12939,Michael," Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks."
12940,Dwight,"Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. "
12941,Dwight,"Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?"
12942,Dwight,"Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-"
12943,Michael,"No! You idiot!  Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god. "
12944,Michael,"Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine."
12945,Michael,And I really really need to talk to David.
12946,Michael,I was never given a name. 
12947,Pam," Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-"
12948,Angela,That is so unnecessary!
12949,Michael,Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
12950,Michael,"I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad."
12951,Michael,"For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical."
12952,Michael," Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!"
12953,Angela,No. No one wants to see that. 
12954,Kevin,I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
12955,Michael,"Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may."
12956,Michael,"Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved."
12957,Michael,"No, it is not."
12958,Michael,"Ok, so we're on the same page, great."
12959,Michael,"Ok, Michael, what are you doing?"
12960,Michael,How old are you?
12961,Pam,"I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad."
12962,Michael,I'm gonna walk away.
12963,Michael,"I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room."
12964,Pam,"And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one."
12965,Michael,What is that smaller stripper holding?
12966,Pam,Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
12967,Michael,"Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles."
12968,Michael,Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
12969,Jim,"No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please."
12970,Jim,You pet the animals and they pet you back.
12971,Michael,It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
12972,Pam,It's really just a regular shaped cake.
12973,Michael,"But it's cool, and it's-"
12974,Michael,"Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . ."
12975,Michael,"Yeah, why don't you do that?"
12976,Michael,"Yeah, here we go. Ok."
12977,Michael,Newsflash: I've been here for fifteen years. Headline: You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
12978,Michael,"Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. "
12979,Jim,"Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker. And a great number two for the office."
12980,Jim,"Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me."
12981,Jim,"Assistant regional manager, yeah."
12982,Jim,"Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that."
12983,Michael,"Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? "
12984,Michael, So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
12985,Michael,"Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned."
12986,Michael,"Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?"
12987,Michael,"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again."
12988,Michael,Clearly that's what you wanted.
12989,Michael,Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
12990,Michael,I've put having a family on hold.
12991,Michael,And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
12992,Angela,"It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner."
12993,Jim,See ya. See ya.  Bye!
12994,Jim,"And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear."
12995,Angela," Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?"
12996,Michael,"I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that."
12997,Michael,You have no idea how high I can fly.
12998,Michael,"I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left."
12999,Michael,"Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door."
13000,Oscar,At least he is in the building.
13001,Michael,"No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!"
13002,Pam,He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
13003,Pam,"Okay focus. Focus. You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?"
13004,Michael,"I looked at Wallace and I said ""I quit!"" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said ""You have no idea how high I can fly."""
13005,Michael,Why would I do that?
13006,Angela,"Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?"
13007,Kevin,That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
13008,Michael,You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
13009,Oscar,I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday.  But I dream... so...
13010,Jim," About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying."
13011,Kevin,Michael is that scotch?
13012,Michael,"Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on."
13013,Michael," What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories."
13014,Michael,I have a job.
13015,Andy,For four more days.
13016,Pam,Do you have any leads on a job?
13017,Michael,"Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted."
13018,Jim,You called any headhunters?
13019,Michael,Any good headhunter knows I am available.
13020,Dwight,"Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,"
13021,Jim,"Right, cause that's what we are talking about."
13022,Michael,You're 'I need you to' is my command.
13023,Andy,Can I talk to you a minute?
13024,Michael,You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.  Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
13025,Andy,I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  What's that?
13026,Michael,Oh! Hey. What is this about?
13027,Andy,"Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell..."
13028,Andy,I hope I get to work with you someday again.
13029,Michael,"Me too, me too. Is this wine?"
13030,Michael,I already have wine.
13031,Pam,"Uh, yes. Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes."
13032,Kevin,When will the new copier be ready?
13033,Pam,I'm working on it Kev.
13034,Kevin,You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.
13035,Pam,It'll be ready soon.
13036,Kevin,Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
13037,Pam,Is that what 'soon' means to you?
13038,Pam,Then come back soon.
13039,Pam,"During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'"
13040,Angela," Bandit, No! No no no!"
13041,Pam,"Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. "
13042,Jim, Its Monster dot com. Singular.
13043,Michael,"You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. "
13044,Michael, What am I gong to do? Uh... .
13045,Jim,Yeah... .you want me to come in your office? Oh.
13046,Michael,"Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes."
13047,Jim,I would prefer not to.
13048,Michael,Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
13049,Jim,You're starting your own paper company?
13050,Michael,Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper.
13051,Jim,Do you know the industry is in decline?
13052,Michael,Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
13053,Michael,"Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes."
13054,Jim,"No, I did that before, it added nothing."
13055,Michael,"Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?"
13056,Jim,I am not gonna do this.
13057,Jim,"And you are not going to, either."
13058,Michael,"Oh, agreed, mmm, except..."
13059,Jim,"Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary. Because they're set up to do that kind of thing."
13060,Michael,Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
13061,Dwight, Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
13062,Pam,"No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions."
13063,Dwight,Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II.
13064,Pam,"That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?"
13065,Dwight,"Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus."
13066,Dwight,My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
13067,Michael,"Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying ""Dunder Mifflin"" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?"
13068,Pam,Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
13069,Michael,You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.
13070,Pam,Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
13071,Michael,"This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now."
13072,Pam,Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
13073,Michael,"Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?"
13074,Pam,"Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image."
13075,Michael,Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
13076,Michael,Thank you very much.
13077,Angela,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone. I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about. Earlier."
13078,Angela,"Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim."
13079,Angela,Okay. Bye Charles. Well you'll let me know. Good bye.
13080,Michael,I'm starting my own paper company.
13081,Michael,Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.
13082,Andy,"Ehh...  well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?"
13083,Dwight,Your own paper company.
13084,Michael,"Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so"
13085,Michael,"Potential, lots of potential. yes."
13086,Dwight,What a courageous venture.
13087,Michael,"It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um..."
13088,Dwight,"Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities..."
13089,Michael,"That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing."
13090,Michael,So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.
13091,Dwight,"You know, I would love to put a pin in that."
13092,Pam,"Everyone, can I have your attention. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? "
13093,Pam,Meredith...  Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin!
13094,Pam,"I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did."
13095,Oscar,You put a note in my food?
13096,Michael,I made it sterile.
13097,Oscar,"Just to say ""sterile"" doesn't make it so."
13098,Michael,"I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me."
13099,Oscar,"Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?"
13100,Oscar,"You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?"
13101,Michael,"Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me."
13102,Oscar,It's just not prudent Michael.
13103,Michael,"Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now."
13104,Michael,"Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company."
13105,Michael,"Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars."
13106,Michael,You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
13107,Pam,"I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels..."
13108,Michael,"Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks..."
13109,Michael,"Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building."
13110,Kevin,"I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy. And he's super funny. Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there."
13111,Michael, Well here we are... I would just like to...
13112,Michael," Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!"
13113,Andy, What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
13114,Kevin,I think he's singing.
13115,Oscar,I can't believe this is really happening.
13116,Michael,... and I feel free!
13117,Oscar,"And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. "
13118,Andy,"The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day."
13119,Michael,"Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!"
13120,Angela,These are for employees only.
13121,Michael,"Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone."
13122,Kevin,"Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?"
13123,Michael,"I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere."
13124,Kevin,But you didn't want to start with us?
13125,Michael,"No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?"
13126,Jim,"I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else."
13127,Michael,So which way are you leaning?
13128,Jim,Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
13129,Michael,"Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be?  Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go!"
13130,Michael,"Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!"
13131,Michael,I think maybe Hank should be here.
13132,Michael,"You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose.  Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it."
13133,Pam,I'm going with him.
13134,Jim,Pam! You can't be serious.
13135,Pam,"Michael, wait! I'm coming with you."
13136,Michael,Okay. It's going to be great.
13137,Pam,"Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore."
13138,Michael,"Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim?"
13139,Michael,"Well, okay, lets go."
13140,Pam,"Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so..."
13141,Jim,"Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you..."
13142,Michael,Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
13143,Jim,"I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye."
13144,Pam,"Okay, see you later."
13145,Jim," You gonna answer that, Kev?"
13146,Kevin,"Oh, right. Thanks.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you.  Oscar, your mom!"
13147,Jim,Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically?  I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
13148,Kevin,Please hold.  Andy! Phone call.
13149,Jim,"No.  Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier."
13150,Kevin,"Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it."
13151,Jim,"It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again."
13152,Kevin,"Okay. Andy, get ready.  Transfer. Extension. Transfer."
13153,Andy,"It is 1-3-4, Kev! "
13154,Andy,You are murdering the Nard-dog!
13155,Kevin, This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. 
13156,Angela,You're bad at this too!
13157,Kevin, Just... don't answer that call!
13158,Kevin,Your call is very important to us. Ple-
13159,Pam,"Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple.  Look, it's official! "
13160,Michael,"Oh, good. My hooker's here.  Hi."
13161,Pam,"Michael, you were expecting me, right?"
13162,Michael,Yes I was. Yes I was.
13163,Pam,Are you wearing anything under the robe?
13164,Michael,"That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in."
13165,Pam,"This looks great, Michael."
13166,Michael,Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
13167,Pam,... Square is fine.
13168,Angela,"Charles, where were you born?"
13169,Andy,"How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day."
13170,Jim, Would you please stop that?
13171,Jim,You're breathing very heavily.
13172,Dwight,This is how I breathe.
13173,Dwight,If you want to tell me -
13174,Jim,Oh no. I was just -
13175,Dwight,Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! 
13176,Pam,"So, what do you say we get started?"
13177,Michael,So how you feeling about the new company?
13178,Pam,I feel good.  Wow.
13179,Michael,You excited? About the new company?
13180,Pam,Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
13181,Pam,"We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second.  Michael. Stop for a second."
13182,Michael,"No, I'm whipping them."
13183,Pam,"No, I know you are."
13184,Pam,Just let me have... Oh.
13185,Michael,"Let go, please. Just gimmee -"
13186,Pam,"Fine!  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
13187,Michael,"I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs."
13188,Michael, I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
13189,Pam,"You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -"
13190,Michael,"I'm not overwhelmed, Pam."
13191,Pam,"I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff."
13192,Pam,"Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check.  Eat an enormous breakfast. Check."
13193,Michael,"Don't patronize me, Pam."
13194,Pam,I think you should get dressed.
13195,Michael,I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
13196,Pam,"Michael, that seems impossible."
13197,Pam,We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
13198,Michael,Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
13199,Michael,He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
13200,Pam,No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
13201,Michael,Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
13202,Michael,He worked at that telemarketing place.
13203,Michael,"Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor."
13204,Pam,We have an investor already?
13205,Michael,Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
13206,Michael,"Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'.  Umm..."
13207,Pam,Hey! We need to get you dressed!
13208,Pam,"I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship.  Hey! You look great!  Let's go!"
13209,Andy,Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
13210,Andy,I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
13211,Andy,Ahhh. You b*st*rd! That shoulda been me!
13212,Jim,"I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly."
13213,Pam,Next on the list - open the mail.
13214,Michael,"Oh. Wow. ""Michael Scott Paper Company."" Okay. Very official. ""Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."""
13215,Pam,"No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add ""find office""..."
13216,Michael,How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
13217,Pam,Next on the list -- song parodies.
13218,Michael,"Okay. Okay. ""Achey Breaky Fart."""
13219,Pam,Great. Let's sing it in the car.
13220,Michael,"No! No No. No. ""My Stumps."" Like ""My Humps"" but a guy with no legs."
13221,Michael,We can do this.
13222,Pam,We can do this.
13223,Andy,"Whoa! And he just goes, ""Boom"".  Goal!"
13224,Andy,"You know your soccer, man."
13225,Andy,"I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but..."
13226,Jim,"Uh, no. Nope. Not really."
13227,Jim,It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
13228,Dwight,"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it."
13229,Dwight,You can be so modest sometimes.
13230,Jim,"Well, maybe you should get back to work."
13231,Dwight,Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
13232,Jim,Maybe we will someday.
13233,Dwight,Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
13234,Dwight,Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
13235,Dwight,I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
13236,Dwight,"Jim, what do you say?"
13237,Andy,I'm in it to win.
13238,Jim,Let's... eh... see ya.
13239,Jim,"Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team."
13240,Pam,We have a meeting with an investor today.
13241,Michael,"Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay."
13242,Pam,"Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram."
13243,Michael,"Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  It's Michael."
13244,Ryan,"I'm swamped, Michael.  Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27."
13245,Michael,"Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files."
13246,Pam,"Yes. Yes, it's possible."
13247,Michael,"Well, it has always been a lifelong dream."
13248,Pam,Michael! What's going on?
13249,Pam,This wasn't on the list.
13250,Pam, When did you add this to the list?
13251,Michael,"Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?"
13252,Ryan,Sixty thousand dollars a year.
13253,Pam,You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
13254,Ryan,"What do you make, secretary?"
13255,Ryan,"I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so..."
13256,Michael,Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
13257,Ryan,What size shoes are you guys?
13258,Ryan,"What are those, a men's ten?"
13259,Michael, Look what he's doing.
13260,Pam,What is he doing?
13261,Michael,"He's stealing them. Okay, okay."
13262,Michael,He's already paying for himself.
13263,Jim,"Oh, there he goes."
13264,Jim,"Aw, it's gonna be the  worst."
13265,Ryan,Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
13266,Michael,"People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want."
13267,Michael,"Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper."
13268,Michael,"Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit."
13269,Michael,By wanting it more. By working hard-
13270,Michael,Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
13271,Jim,Alright! Let's do it.
13272,Jim,Kickoff.  My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork.  Alright! 
13273,Michael,"And I offer same day, free delivery."
13274,Michael,Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
13275,Michael,"Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other..."
13276,Michael,"Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for."
13277,Andy,"Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. "
13278,Dwight,"Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?"
13279,Jim,"Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice."
13280,Ryan,Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
13281,Michael,"Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that."
13282,Pam,I can't do this.
13283,Pam,I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
13284,Pam,"I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?"
13285,Michael,Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
13286,Pam,We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
13287,Michael,"Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay..."
13288,Pam,"How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!"
13289,Michael,"I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit."
13290,Michael,"So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? "
13291,Michael,"You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating."
13292,Michael,"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine."
13293,Pam,I could work here. I could see this.
13294,Michael,It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
13295,Michael,"Yeah, I'm good. You good?"
13296,Michael,"You know what they say, keep your friends close. "
13297,Michael,"Yes, I am, Charles."
13298,Michael,"Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared."
13299,Michael,"It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  Okay. Not gonna make this one. "
13300,Michael,Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! 
13301,Michael,"I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!"
13302,Jim,"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?"
13303,Jim,"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says ""You wanted me"" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had."
13304,Erin,"If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name."
13305,Kevin,I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
13306,Michael,We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
13307,Pam,What should we do now?
13308,Michael,"We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon."
13309,Michael,"I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it."
13310,Michael,"I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. "
13311,Pam,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet."
13312,Andy,What do you think?
13313,Dwight,Let me check.  Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
13314,Dwight,"Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do."
13315,Ryan,"You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style."
13316,Michael,Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
13317,Ryan,"Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space."
13318,Jim,What the hell's a rundown?
13319,Jim,When did you need that rundown by?
13320,Jim,"Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon.  Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?"
13321,Dwight,You know there's a ghost in this office
13322,Dwight,A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
13323,Erin,Why was she in this building?
13324,Dwight,"Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor."
13325,Dwight,Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
13326,Dwight,It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
13327,Dwight,"That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next. "
13328,Dwight,Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
13329,Erin,Just got some ice.
13330,Andy,"Oh, this is awkward. "
13331,Andy,Uh oh! Oh! Oh! 
13332,Erin,So I'll see you guys around!
13333,Michael,Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?
13334,Ryan,Pam's better at that stuff
13335,Pam,That is so insulting.
13336,Ryan,How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
13337,Pam,"Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times."
13338,Ryan,"I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other."
13339,Pam,Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
13340,Michael,"Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals."
13341,Ryan,Yeah I make originals too.
13342,Michael,Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
13343,Michael,Would someone just make the copy?
13344,Michael,Just make that copy okay?
13345,Pam,"Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?"
13346,Ryan,That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
13347,Pam,I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
13348,Ryan,You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
13349,Pam,Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
13350,Ryan,This is from the sun.
13351,Pam,Oh yeah I bet.
13352,Michael,"They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim."
13353,Pam,"Michael, we can hear you."
13354,Michael,"I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B."
13355,Pam,Okay it's my turn.
13356,Ryan,"No don't take that, give that back!"
13357,Pam,Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
13358,Ryan,I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
13359,Pam,"You're gonna make another ""spreadsheet."""
13360,Pam,Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
13361,Ryan,"Go make a copy, secretary."
13362,Michael,"They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?"
13363,Dwight,"Hey buddy, what are you up to?"
13364,Dwight,"Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your pen1s."
13365,Dwight,"Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?"
13366,Andy,"The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man."
13367,Dwight,"And I, yours. So I will cede her to you."
13368,Andy,"Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-"
13369,Dwight,"Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just,  Boom."
13370,Michael,Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
13371,Michael,Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
13372,Pam,We could work from home.
13373,Ryan,Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
13374,Michael,"Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?"
13375,Michael,"No, you're supposed to say, ""Rock the house."""
13376,Pam,How would we know that?
13377,Jim,"Hey dude, you know what a ""rundown"" is?"
13378,Oscar,Use it in a sentence.
13379,Jim,"""Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"" "
13380,Jim,"""This rundown better be really good""?"
13381,Oscar,I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
13382,Jim,Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
13383,Oscar,Why don't you just ask him--
13384,Jim,"No. I can't. It was like, hours ago."
13385,Oscar,What have you been doing?
13386,Kevin,Try it in another sentence.
13387,Ryan,"Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, ""Hey cop, you like donuts?"" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there.  I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser.  No, not that one."
13388,Pam,I thought that was your corner.
13389,Michael,"No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work."
13390,Pam,So my corner's the one with the copier?
13391,Michael,"Pam, I don't make the rules. "
13392,Ryan,"Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is."
13393,Jim,"Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with."
13394,Jim,"I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now."
13395,Jim,"Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?"
13396,Jim,Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
13397,Jim,No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
13398,Erin,Can I help you?
13399,Pam,Hey I'm here to see Charles.
13400,Pam,I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
13401,Pam,"Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now."
13402,Pam,"Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people."
13403,Pam,Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
13404,Pam,I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
13405,Michael,"Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour."
13406,Michael,Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
13407,Ryan,Are we staying til five?
13408,Michael,"Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em."
13409,Michael,"Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?"
13410,Ryan,I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
13411,Michael,"Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company."
13412,Michael,You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
13413,Pam,"Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff."
13414,Pam,That's as specific as I'd like to be.
13415,Michael,"Well, at least you're still being honest with me."
13416,Jim,There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
13417,Jim,Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
13418,Jim,"No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?"
13419,Jim,The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
13420,Jim,Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
13421,Pam,"We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves."
13422,Pam,"Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper."
13423,Michael,These are shaped like paper.
13424,Erin,"Country roads, take me home, to the place... Sorry. I like that song. You're good!"
13425,Andy,"That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like "
13426,Andy,What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
13427,Dwight,"Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it."
13428,Dwight,Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
13429,Dwight,"In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend"
13430,Dwight,"Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh"
13431,Michael,"I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  It is a disgusting sandwich.  And the reason I tell you this story.  Pick up the phone."
13432,Pam,"Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?"
13433,Michael,Don't tell them we have free delivery! 
13434,Pam,We already offered free delivery!
13435,Michael,They don't know that!
13436,Pam,"Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!"
13437,Michael,Give him a guarantee.
13438,Pam,A guarantee of what?
13439,Michael,Just say the word.
13440,Pam,"And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell."
13441,Pam,I made a sale!
13442,Ryan,We did it !
13443,Michael,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
13444,Michael,"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important."
13445,Andy,Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
13446,Dwight,"Rebel Yell, Billy Idol"
13447,Andy,Aw!! Way better a cappella
13448,Pam,Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
13449,Pam,We're getting pretty good at it.
13450,Jim,"Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right."
13451,Jim,"Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love."
13452,Andy,This is my solo. 
13453,Pam,I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
13454,Andy,Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
13455,Jim,"I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?"
13456,Andy,"Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000."
13457,Pam,I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
13458,Andy,Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
13459,Dwight,These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
13460,Dwight,Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
13461,Dwight,"'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket!  Okay."
13462,Dwight,"When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared."
13463,Dwight,Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
13464,Dwight,They have some great kitchen ideas.
13465,Michael,"Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?"
13466,Dwight,"It's small, I know."
13467,Michael,I really appreciate it.
13468,Dwight,"Thanks, Michael.  Wait, what is this?"
13469,Michael,It's for your trouble.
13470,Dwight,Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.
13471,Michael,"No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this."
13472,Dwight,"Michael, you know I can't take this."
13473,Dwight,But don't forget you owe me $10.
13474,Michael,That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
13475,Andy,What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
13476,Jim,I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
13477,Andy,It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
13478,Jim,Am I going down a road?
13479,Andy,"When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance."
13480,Jim,"It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this."
13481,Andy,"I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things."
13482,Jim,"I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up."
13483,Michael,"Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women."
13484,Pam,I'm not gonna do that.
13485,Michael,That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
13486,Ryan,I can get there.
13487,Michael,"Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce."
13488,Michael,Bring it in. Morning cheer. 
13489,Pam,I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
13490,Dwight,You needed to speak to me?
13491,Dwight,I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
13492,Dwight,Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
13493,Dwight,Your concern is noted.
13494,Dwight,Like a wolf. Thank you.
13495,Michael, I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
13496,Dwight,"I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up."
13497,Michael,Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
13498,Dwight,"No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast."
13499,Michael,I'm not following you.
13500,Dwight,"Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero."
13501,Michael,"Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift."
13502,Dwight,"Good, do you see what I'm saying?"
13503,Michael,Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
13504,Michael,Can I use it? 
13505,Michael," Dwight, are you talking about us?"
13506,Dwight,It is possible that I could be talking about us.
13507,Michael,Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
13508,Dwight,It is the situation that we are in now.
13509,Michael,"So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?"
13510,Dwight,I'm not a barbarian.
13511,Michael,Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
13512,Michael,Is the cool new guy Charles?
13513,Dwight,I've said too much.
13514,Jim,"Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-"
13515,Jim,-I just don't know if I can do it.
13516,Andy,"That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?"
13517,Jim,"It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy."
13518,Andy,"And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants.  Ah, what'd you do that for?"
13519,Jim, You know that I was doin' this.
13520,Michael,"Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?"
13521,Michael,Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
13522,Michael,Mm-do... Dwight would not-
13523,Dwight,"I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it."
13524,Pam,"Michael, are you alright?"
13525,Michael,It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
13526,Pam,Tell us what you're talking about.
13527,Michael,"It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon."
13528,Pam,We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
13529,Michael,"I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?"
13530,Jim, I just totally blew a sales call.
13531,Andy,"Bro, I do that all the time."
13532,Jim,"Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!"
13533,Andy,"Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?"
13534,Jim,"Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back."
13535,Andy,"Well, so what? Your body's a ten."
13536,Jim,I said forget it. 
13537,Dwight,"I think you have the wrong number, Michael."
13538,Michael,"I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you."
13539,Michael,I'm just getting hardcore with him.
13540,Michael,"Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby."
13541,Michael, Is Mr. Schofield there?
13542,Dwight,I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
13543,Dwight,"And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! "
13544,Michael," Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.  Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?"
13545,Ryan,Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
13546,Pam,"I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight."
13547,Dwight,"And no, I cannot lower my current prices.  Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown."
13548,Dwight,"Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still..."
13549,Michael,"Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?"
13550,Dwight,I would like to arrange a truce.
13551,Michael,"So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?"
13552,Dwight,Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
13553,Michael,No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
13554,Michael,"Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet."
13555,Michael,You have two seconds. 
13556,Michael,I hope you're not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
13557,Dwight,You were making me do things that were not all right.
13558,Michael,So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
13559,Dwight,And not come through for you?
13560,Michael,"If you want a truce, I will give you a truce."
13561,Dwight,I want a truce.
13562,Dwight,Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
13563,Dwight,I had fish yesterday.
13564,Michael, Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
13565,Dwight,"Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic."
13566,Michael,Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
13567,Dwight,I hit a bear.
13568,Dwight,"He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.  Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?"
13569,Dwight,"Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? "
13570,Michael,"Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec."
13571,Ryan,We can spend a couple days there.
13572,Pam,"Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!"
13573,Dwight,Did you enjoy your lunch?
13574,Michael,"Dwight, not now, we've been robbed."
13575,Dwight,"No, Michael, you were sabotaged."
13576,Michael,"No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic.  You?"
13577,Michael,What about our truce?
13578,Dwight,"You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!"
13579,Michael,"Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it."
13580,Dwight,And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
13581,Dwight,"Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is  Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say."
13582,Dwight," Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, ""great salesman, better friend.""  ""Tall"" and ""beets."""
13583,Dwight,"And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife.  I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here."
13584,Michael,"Dwight, do you mind if we talk?"
13585,Dwight,Sure. That'd be fine.
13586,Michael,"If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed."
13587,Dwight,This is war and that is what happens.
13588,Michael,"Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client."
13589,Dwight,"Oh, no. No. No. No. No."
13590,Michael,"Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now."
13591,Michael,"You can hear me, but I can't hear you."
13592,Michael,"Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much."
13593,Dwight,Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
13594,Michael,Walking in the door...
13595,Michael,"Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. "
13596,Michael," Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn."
13597,Michael,"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates."
13598,Dwight,Are you saying you invented paper?
13599,Andy,"Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now."
13600,Kevin,I guess I could be nicer.
13601,Andy,"Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?"
13602,Jim,"Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together."
13603,Andy,"Uh, that's not what was-"
13604,Jim,"And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will."
13605,Andy,"Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours."
13606,Michael,What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
13607,Dwight,It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! 
13608,Dwight,"Ha ha! April 13th, 2002."
13609,Dwight,"I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased."
13610,Dwight,"La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!"
13611,Michael,"I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin..."
13612,Michael,"Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month."
13613,Dwight,What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
13614,Michael,That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
13615,Michael,"Good, good, good. I will see you."
13616,Dwight,"Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?"
13617,Michael,"I color code all my info. I wrote ""gay son"" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means ""Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?"" Most colors mean ""Don't say it."""
13618,Dwight,"How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?"
13619,Michael,"I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess."
13620,Michael,"It's 4:30 in the morning. Do you know where your kids are? If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do. They're gonna be in this van. With me. Who am I? Nothing to fear. I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route."
13621,Michael," Time to make the donuts.  Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on.  De-nied!"
13622,Ryan,We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now. Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
13623,Michael,"Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  Hey Pam."
13624,Pam,"We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says ""Alleluia Church of Scranton."" in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it."
13625,Pam,"You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?"
13626,Pam,"Oh, awesome. You're a life saver.  Wait, is this just milk and sugar?"
13627,Michael,That's what I said.
13628,Pam,Do you drink this every day?
13629,Michael,"We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those."
13630,Pam," Oh, oh, excuse me! Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh, it's a paper company now. It's not for the church."
13631,Jim,"Oh, they're my client."
13632,Dwight," Shame, Jim. I expected more."
13633,Andy,"Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys."
13634,Andy,I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
13635,Andy,I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it.
13636,Dwight,It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
13637,Angela,"Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not."
13638,Dwight,"Been there, done that."
13639,Michael,You know what we need? We need some couches in here.
13640,Ryan,"Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy."
13641,Michael,"Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft."
13642,Pam,Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
13643,Michael,"Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top."
13644,Pam,"Yeah, I know what a loft is."
13645,Ryan,Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
13646,Michael,Most do in the magazines.
13647,Ryan,Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
13648,Michael,We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft.
13649,Dwight,"David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you."
13650,Michael,How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
13651,Michael,"They are correct, sir."
13652,Michael,Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.
13653,Ryan,"Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable."
13654,Michael,"Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is."
13655,Ryan,Explain what you think that is.
13656,Michael,Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
13657,Michael,"Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again."
13658,Michael,Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.
13659,Michael,"Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing.  Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check."
13660,Pam,"When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, ""Drive, kid. I trust you."""
13661,Jim,"Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?"
13662,Dwight,"Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak."
13663,Dwight,I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.
13664,Jim,Really? Does he do good work or--
13665,Dwight," No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. "
13666,Jim, Hey. I saw you called.
13667,Pam,We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
13668,Jim,"Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. We'll be okay."
13669,Pam,That's what Michael said.
13670,Jim,"Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  Oh, that's my new ""Dwight"" ring."
13671,Dwight," Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way."
13672,Jim,"Oh, okay.  Don't worry about it."
13673,Michael,Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
13674,Pam,"Steve Martin's not dead, Michael."
13675,Michael,I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.
13676,Pam,You want to hear something sad?
13677,Michael,I would love that.
13678,Pam,"So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview."
13679,Ryan,I never went to Thailand.
13680,Ryan,I went to Fort Lauderdale.
13681,Ryan,"Yeah, it was amazing. There was a great Pad Thai place, though."
13682,Michael,I love Pad Thai.
13683,Ryan,You've never had Pad Thai.
13684,Michael,No. There's a lot I haven't done.
13685,Jim,"Now, this is the projection over three months?"
13686,Dwight,"Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something?"
13687,Dwight,"There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom."
13688,Jim,"Oh, but you didn't."
13689,Dwight,"Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure."
13690,Jim,"Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--"
13691,Jim,I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
13692,Dwight,"You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this?"
13693,Jim,"Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit."
13694,Jim,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
13695,Michael,"We're not hiring, Jim."
13696,Jim,Actually here for something else.
13697,Michael,"Listen, I can't make you laugh right now."
13698,Jim,"You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales."
13699,Jim,David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
13700,Pam,Seriously? Are you being serious?
13701,Michael,"Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--"
13702,Michael,No-- We don't have--
13703,Jim,Oh! See I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
13704,Jim,Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
13705,Michael,"Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks."
13706,Jim,Missed the last part.
13707,Ryan,"Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we're broke."
13708,Ryan,That we're having any problem at all.
13709,Pam,"Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke."
13710,Michael,"Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke."
13711,Michael,"Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it."
13712,Ryan,"No, man. You're-- you're fine."
13713,Pam,We have to come from a position of strength.
13714,Michael,"I'm good, I'm good."
13715,Ryan,Just put it out of your mind.
13716,Michael,It is. I'm good.
13717,Michael,"Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected.  Well, well, well. How the turntables..."
13718,Michael,And we are prepared to reject that offer.
13719,Ryan,"Michael, you haven't even heard--"
13720,Michael,Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?
13721,Michael,Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
13722,Angela,What do you hear?
13723,Michael,I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.
13724,Michael, We'll have to talk--
13725,Ryan,We'll have to talk about this.
13726,Michael,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
13727,Michael,We are so rich.
13728,Pam,Are you kidding me?
13729,Dwight,"Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold.  Charles."
13730,Dwight,May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
13731,Dwight,They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures.
13732,Jim,"No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?"
13733,Dwight,"You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty."
13734,Jim,What are your top five cases?
13735,Dwight,I'm gonna answer Charles first.
13736,Jim,Because you've solved zero cases.
13737,Dwight,"Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed."
13738,Dwight,I'm not-- I'm not following you.
13739,Pam,Can you give us another minute please?
13740,Ryan,"How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000."
13741,Pam,Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
13742,Michael,"It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?"
13743,Ryan,"I would rather have $60,000, honestly."
13744,Pam,"No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer."
13745,Pam,"Agreed. But that's all, okay."
13746,Ryan,"Yeah, discuss these things--"
13747,Michael,"Shut up, shut up. Hello?"
13748,Michael,I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring.
13749,Michael,And I want Charles gone.
13750,Michael,I need him gone.
13751,Michael,"Okay, then I want Pam back."
13752,Michael,"Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday."
13753,Michael,"You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me."
13754,Michael,And dental this time.
13755,Michael,These are our demands.
13756,Michael,"Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names."
13757,Michael,That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.
13758,Michael,Can we have the room please?
13759,Michael,Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!
13760,Michael,There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.
13761,Michael,"No, no. You're done."
13762,Kevin,"At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best."
13763,Michael,"Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?"
13764,Michael," It's Michael Scott.  Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes."
13765,Michael,"Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting."
13766,Dwight, Wh--what are you doing?
13767,Michael,"If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now."
13768,Angela,People are dressed inappropriately.
13769,Michael,"Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different."
13770,Jim,Can you give us a hint?
13771,Michael,"When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that."
13772,Michael,"Oscar, what were you going to say?"
13773,Oscar,Nothing. I didn't say anything.
13774,Erin,Do I still have a job here?
13775,Michael,"Not important.  Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen."
13776,Michael,"It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--"
13777,Dwight,"Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?"
13778,Michael,"No, you lost those clients."
13779,Andy,"I call foul, sir."
13780,Dwight,You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
13781,Michael,"Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can."
13782,Pam, Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
13783,Pam,"Well, you have good taste."
13784,Angela,The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
13785,Angela,"Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet.  Do your job!"
13786,Michael," There you are, my friend."
13787,Dwight,"Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully."
13788,Dwight,"No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words."
13789,Dwight,When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.
13790,Oscar,"I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change."
13791,Oscar,I don't think so.
13792,Dwight,"Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?"
13793,Andy,What are you still doing not at your desk?
13794,Dwight,Did you even read the memo?
13795,Andy,All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
13796,Dwight,"No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto."
13797,Andy,"Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn."
13798,Dwight,"Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing."
13799,Dwight,"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone."
13800,Jim,Can I address that?
13801,Dwight,"No, you're too close."
13802,Dwight,"Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?"
13803,Dwight,He doesn't like it.
13804,Dwight,"Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?"
13805,Dwight,Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
13806,Dwight,"No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things."
13807,Jim,Of course. What is like a hostage?
13808,Andy,We could write a strong-worded letter.
13809,Dwight,Words will never be enough.
13810,Dwight,"No, pictures are too interpretive."
13811,Jim,"Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly."
13812,Dwight,"Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs."
13813,Jim,Great. See you upstairs.
13814,Dwight,"C'mon.  Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--"
13815,Ryan,You look so classy in that picture.
13816,Michael,I do? Well--Where is that bowl?
13817,Jim,"Hey, you have a second?"
13818,Michael,Michael Scott Paper Company only.
13819,Jim,"Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen."
13820,Michael,"I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom."
13821,Jim,"This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now."
13822,Ryan,It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
13823,Michael,"The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with."
13824,Michael,"Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow."
13825,Michael,"That was us, right there."
13826,Pam,We were something else.
13827,Ryan,What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
13828,Ryan,"Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style."
13829,Michael,"Yeah, yeah. The Shield."
13830,Jim,"I know. Yeah, it's...kinda--"
13831,Jim,That's true. That's right. Yeah.
13832,Michael,Hey gang. Where you been?
13833,Michael,"What'd you have, Stanley?"
13834,Andy,"I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it. Her name was Flo, she had black hair."
13835,Michael,"So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon."
13836,Michael,"Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?"
13837,Michael,I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
13838,Michael,Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
13839,Michael,"Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys."
13840,Oscar,"Meredith, your boob is out."
13841,Jim,"Well, what if I just do this?"
13842,Jim,I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
13843,Ryan,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?"
13844,Dwight,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone."
13845,Ryan,Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.
13846,Dwight,Give me the phone.
13847,Ryan,Things have been generally good.
13848,Dwight,Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
13849,Ryan,"Look, uh, Mr. Bart..."
13850,Ryan,At these prices with this service...
13851,Dwight,"Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone."
13852,Ryan,You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
13853,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up."
13854,Ryan,"No, no, no. Sir, don't listen."
13855,Dwight,"I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness.  Ryan!"
13856,Ryan,"Stop flustering me, everybody!"
13857,Dwight,Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!
13858,Pam,"You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan."
13859,Dwight,You're a secretary! What do you know?
13860,Dwight,And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.
13861,Michael,"Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight."
13862,Dwight,"We want our clients back or we quit, Michael."
13863,Michael,You guys gotta be kidding.
13864,Dwight,"No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company."
13865,Michael,"I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one."
13866,Michael,"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy."
13867,Michael,I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
13868,Dwight,Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?
13869,Michael,Whatever you guys did earlier.
13870,Dwight,I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
13871,Michael,"Just do it, okay?"
13872,Michael,Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
13873,Dwight,I'll do the best I can.
13874,Michael,Are you kidding me?
13875,Dwight,Deceit does not come easy to me.
13876,Erin,I really love your outfit.
13877,Erin,You look like J-Lo.
13878,Michael,"So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry."
13879,Michael,"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, ""apology accepted"", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark."
13880,Michael,They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
13881,Michael,"Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople."
13882,Michael,"Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along.  However, I rescind my apology."
13883,Michael,You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
13884,Darryl,What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
13885,Ryan,"Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on."
13886,Pam,He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
13887,Ryan,I think you should get it. You really grew into it.
13888,Pam,Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
13889,Ryan,"If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you."
13890,Jim,"Oh, I'm engaged to Pam."
13891,Jim,Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
13892,Michael,Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
13893,Jim,Sure. Let me just finish this turn.
13894,Michael, And Bingo was his name. Let's go.
13895,Michael,I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
13896,Jim,"I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that."
13897,Michael,You're close with Pam too.
13898,Jim,"Eh, she's nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list."
13899,Michael,"Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice."
13900,Michael,I like his hair.
13901,Jim,"Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale."
13902,Jim,He definitely stole my iPod.
13903,Michael,That sounds pretty biased.
13904,Jim,You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
13905,Michael,"I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice."
13906,Michael,I don't need to tell you that.
13907,Jim,I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
13908,Michael,"I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam."
13909,Michael,"Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan."
13910,Jim,"All right. You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice."
13911,Michael,"Ho-ho, man! Wow.  Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have s*x with you unless you bring out the garba--"
13912,Michael,I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
13913,Andy,"You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki."
13914,Dwight,"Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants."
13915,Andy,You're running from the problem.
13916,Michael,"Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat.  Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--"
13917,Michael,I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--
13918,Pam,"Okay, I get it.  Why are you giggling? Is this a joke?  Michael, is this-- did I get the job?"
13919,Pam,"For real, you're not kidding?"
13920,Michael,"No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great."
13921,Pam,"Oh, Michael, thank you. Thank you."
13922,Pam,Thank you. You will not be sorry.
13923,Michael,"You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic."
13924,Pam,Oh.  I really thought I didn't get it.
13925,Pam,Yeah. 'Cause you said I didn't
13926,Michael,"Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good."
13927,Michael,"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--"
13928,Pam,Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
13929,Michael,"I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here."
13930,Michael,Oh! What's our receptionists name?
13931,Michael,Could you send her in?
13932,Pam, Erin. Michael wants to see you.
13933,Michael,"This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--"
13934,Erin,"Oh, I can go."
13935,Michael,He will be ushering you out. 
13936,Michael,"Oh, your face! Oh!"
13937,Michael,"No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet."
13938,Erin,"Do they not like me, though?"
13939,Michael,"I don't know, actually."
13940,Erin,Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! 
13941,Erin, Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
13942,Michael," Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso."
13943,Michael,"Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?"
13944,Michael,Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
13945,Pam,"Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor."
13946,Michael,What about the rest of you? 
13947,Michael,"At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people."
13948,Michael,Who else? Who else? Ryan?
13949,Ryan,I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
13950,Ryan,"Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control."
13951,Michael,Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
13952,Angela,No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
13953,Michael,Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
13954,Pam,"If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day."
13955,Pam,"Oh, no. Your battery fell out."
13956,Michael, I... was just learning... to... love.
13957,Erin,"Hi, guys. How you doing?"
13958,Dwight,"Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us."
13959,Dwight," Now, how can I help you?"
13960,Erin,"Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?"
13961,Dwight,"Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -"
13962,Pam,So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
13963,Dwight,"It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate."
13964,Jim,There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
13965,Pam,We're getting married today.
13966,Jim,"So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period."
13967,Pam,Tell 'em how it happened.
13968,Jim,"Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated."
13969,Jim,Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
13970,Pam,You can't leave anyone out.
13971,Pam,"Ok, just get to the good part."
13972,Jim,"Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, "" You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."""
13973,Pam,I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
13974,Erin,Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
13975,Michael,No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
13976,Erin,"Well, I like to swim."
13977,Erin,You have a cool place to come hang.
13978,Michael,"If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so..."
13979,Michael,"Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah."
13980,Michael,Now you got it.
13981,Erin,Now I do got it.
13982,Michael,"Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?"
13983,Michael,You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
13984,Michael,Ok. I love it. I love it.
13985,Michael,"Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone."
13986,Michael,"Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like  Dave died or something."
13987,Michael,Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
13988,Oscar,Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
13989,Michael,I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
13990,Andy, Wittle Andy is afwaid.
13991,Michael,Are you all afwaid?
13992,Michael,Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
13993,Michael,Funk is the problem and the solution.
13994,Michael,I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
13995,Oscar,Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
13996,Michael,"Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it."
13997,Dwight, All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
13998,Michael,"No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco."
13999,Andy,It's like a haunted disco.
14000,Michael,... with coffee but without the haunted.
14001,Michael,It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
14002,Erin,It's a cafe disco.
14003,Kevin,"So, like, a disco cafe?"
14004,Michael,Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
14005,Michael,"Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you."
14006,Michael,Holdin' down the fort.
14007,Kevin,Yeah. This place is great.
14008,Angela,"Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up."
14009,Michael,This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
14010,Kevin,Yeah. Respect the lei.
14011,Angela,"Come on, right now."
14012,Angela,"Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin."
14013,Kevin, Is there a cookie?
14014,Angela,"Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come."
14015,Kevin,I wanted a cookie.
14016,Michael,"Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster."
14017,Andy," Everybody Dance Now"", spins in chair] Oww!"
14018,Michael, Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
14019,Michael,"Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!"
14020,Michael,"Oh, wow! What did you do?"
14021,Michael,You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
14022,Michael,"Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie."
14023,Dwight,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?"
14024,Dwight,Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
14025,Michael,It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
14026,Michael,We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
14027,Michael,"Oh, no. No. No. This is no good."
14028,Dwight,Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
14029,Michael,I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
14030,Dwight,What do you think history is?
14031,Michael,"It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat."
14032,Michael, Alright. Here we go.
14033,Dwight,Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
14034,Erin,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
14035,Michael,"What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you."
14036,Dwight,You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
14037,Michael,"Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry."
14038,Oscar,What happened to Phyllis?
14039,Michael,"Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So..."
14040,Angela,Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
14041,Michael,Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. 
14042,Michael,You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
14043,Michael,I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
14044,Erin,Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
14045,Michael,I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
14046,Dwight, I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
14047,Michael,I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
14048,Dwight,"You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?"
14049,Dwight,"Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?"
14050,Dwight,No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing.  It's like children singing Christmas carols.
14051,Andy,Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
14052,Erin,Ashley! You made it!
14053,Erin,"Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?"
14054,Oscar,I've been here 8 years and I've never...  Rude.
14055,Andy,"I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!"
14056,Michael,Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
14057,Michael,It's better than I imagined it!
14058,Dwight,Tell me where it hurts.
14059,Dwight,Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
14060,Michael,"Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott."
14061,Erin,"Hey, Angela! Welcome to -"
14062,Michael,Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
14063,Angela,No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
14064,Michael,Oh. Alright. There you go.
14065,Angela,No. You need to sign them all.
14066,Michael,No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
14067,Angela,"Look, I hate to be ""that"" person but I just don't like the general spirit of music."
14068,Michael,"I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, "" This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.""  No."
14069,Dwight,"This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour."
14070,Dwight,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa."
14071,Michael,"Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place."
14072,Dwight,I'm gonna with the python.
14073,Dwight,No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
14074,Michael,"Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!"
14075,Angela,You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
14076,Jim, These are for you.
14077,Jim,We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
14078,Michael,Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
14079,Dwight,"Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic."
14080,Dwight,You can't steal what is legally your property.
14081,Andy,This dance competition is not over.
14082,Michael,You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
14083,Jim,Yeah. At least for one more dance.
14084,Michael,"Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to ""Y""."
14085,Pam,This is so cheesy.
14086,Pam,"Yeah. I think maybe I want a ""wedding"" wedding."
14087,Michael,Would you like to dance?
14088,Andy,"Yeah. No. Well, ok."
14089,Andy,"Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing."
14090,Andy,"I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional."
14091,Andy,"Are you sure that's not the ""gay"" ear?"
14092,Andy,Count to twen - count to twenty.
14093,Andy,Agh! Son of a bitch!
14094,Erin," Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back."
14095,Jim,"Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes."
14096,Jim," Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?"
14097,Pam, I can do it.
14098,Dwight, What do you need from me?
14099,Dwight,"Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know.  No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken."
14100,Michael, Uh oh. What's so funny?
14101,Pam,You had to be there.
14102,Michael,"Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale."
14103,Jim," All right, you ready for this?"
14104,Pam,"Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?"
14105,Jim,"Wait, should I have left the car running? "
14106,Pam,"Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics."
14107,Jim,"Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?"
14108,Pam,Tell them what happened last year.
14109,Jim,I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
14110,Pam,"No, no, that guy who hit on me."
14111,Jim,"Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance."
14112,Pam,"Yeah, you don't grab these  for balance."
14113,Dwight,I'm gonna say 30.
14114,Dwight,"Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent."
14115,Dwight,Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? 
14116,Dwight,Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
14117,Kevin,"Michael, isn't that Holly?"
14118,Michael,"We're just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know."
14119,Michael,"Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right."
14120,Michael,All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
14121,Michael,"A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people."
14122,Michael,Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
14123,Michael,"You can go to hell.  I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world."
14124,Michael,"I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: ""Holly, you and I are soup snakes."" The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates."
14125,Jim,"Hey, how are you?"
14126,Jim,I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
14127,Pam,Do you want me to beat him up for you?
14128,Jim,"No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it."
14129,Dwight,Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
14130,Jim,"Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards."
14131,Dwight,"Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!"
14132,Andy,"Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?"
14133,Dwight,Why? I don't understand.
14134,Dwight,"Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it."
14135,Dwight,"I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team."
14136,Andy,... not what I meant.
14137,Michael,"What is up with you two, Holly?"
14138,Michael,"Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported."
14139,Michael,"All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse."
14140,Michael,You bet your fat ass we are.
14141,Michael,"Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin."
14142,Andy," Are you blind?! Are you blind?!  Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger."
14143,Andy,"Okay, I was just looking out for you.  You're doing great, by the way."
14144,Dwight,"Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!"
14145,Dwight,"I could've gotten that, idiot!"
14146,Andy,Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
14147,Dwight,"It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!"
14148,Dwight," Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net."
14149,Dwight,"Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?"
14150,Pam,"Back off, Dwight.  Hyuh!  What?"
14151,Pam,Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
14152,Pam," Hyuh!  Well, look at that, we win!"
14153,Dwight,Yes! We advance to the next round!
14154,Michael,"I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry."
14155,Michael,"Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?"
14156,Andy,Bump! I bumped it!
14157,Dwight,Don't set it to yourself!
14158,Dwight,"You weren't even moving.  Okay, sub!"
14159,Angela,"Rolph, did you not hear me?"
14160,Michael,We could do a movie... sort of thing.
14161,Michael,Could we get a Delorean?
14162,Michael,Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! 
14163,Dwight,"Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- "
14164,Dwight,"Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. "
14165,Michael," Uh, it's a sketch now."
14166,Michael,"Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College."
14167,Michael, Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
14168,Michael,"Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in."
14169,Michael,"I'm Robert Mifflin.  Ah, okay. "
14170,Michael,"Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head."
14171,Michael,"I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!"
14172,Michael,David Wallace told me!!
14173,Michael,Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
14174,Michael,"Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts."
14175,Dwight,"Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever."
14176,Pam,How do you figure?
14177,Dwight,"Because if we don't play, then the other team wins."
14178,Oscar,Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
14179,Kevin,It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. 
14180,Angela,"Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?"
14181,Dwight,"Okay, knock it off, Rolph."
14182,Dwight,"Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-"
14183,Dwight,"Rolph, leave it alone!"
14184,Pam,"Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine."
14185,Pam,"No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second."
14186,Jim,"All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player."
14187,Pam,"Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!"
14188,Dwight, Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
14189,Jim,"All right, you know what?  Let's do this."
14190,Dwight,"Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!!  I'll get it. "
14191,Michael,Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
14192,Michael,I think it went well. I think it was good.
14193,Michael,"No, it was a tough audience."
14194,Michael,"Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them."
14195,Michael,Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
14196,Jim," Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!"
14197,Pam,How long will that take?
14198,Pam,"I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to."
14199,Michael,Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
14200,Michael,Good to see you.  AJ.
14201,Michael,"I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush."
14202,Dwight,"Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?"
14203,Dwight,"No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?"
14204,Dwight,Seven? Can I finish please?
14205,Jim," Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great.  Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs!  Ohh! "
14206,Jim,"This... is Parkour.  Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive.  The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital."
14207,Andy,Do me! Do me!
14208,Andy,Ow! Get off! Get off!
14209,Dwight, Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! 
14210,Michael," Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time."
14211,Andy,"Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster,  360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can."
14212,Dwight, Good. Excellent. Thank you.
14213,Dwight, Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
14214,Dwight,Go put them all in random order.
14215,Dwight,Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
14216,Pam,"This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident.  He didn't do anything sexual.  He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes.  It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program."
14217,Oscar,"I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer."
14218,Michael,"If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming."
14219,Michael,"Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly."
14220,Michael,Did everybody know about this but me?
14221,Pam, We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
14222,Jim,"Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day."
14223,Pam,"Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum."
14224,Jim,"Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?"
14225,Jim,No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
14226,Pam,"Can't back out now, Halpert."
14227,Jim,"What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!"
14228,Pam,"No, keep it up."
14229,Michael, You'll never guess what I know.
14230,Dwight," Okay, let me finish this thought."
14231,Dwight, He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night
14232,Michael, How do you know this?
14233,Dwight," People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom.  Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?"
14234,Michael,"I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?"
14235,Michael," Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said ""The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."""
14236,Michael,I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
14237,Michael, Stanley was on your group date?
14238,Michael, Does anybody else know about this?
14239,Michael,There he goes. There he goes. 
14240,Michael,"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?"
14241,Michael,Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
14242,Pam,Just keep it to yourself then.
14243,Michael,Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
14244,Dwight,Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
14245,Michael,"Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people."
14246,Michael, You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
14247,Michael,Stanley's wife is out of town.
14248,Michael,"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?"
14249,Michael, I don't get it!
14250,Michael, Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
14251,Michael, Stanley is having an affir.
14252,Michael,"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention."
14253,Michael, That and that are the same letter.
14254,Michael,"No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?"
14255,Michael,"T! Yes! Yes! That is a ""T"", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there."
14256,Michael," Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?"
14257,Michael,"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?"
14258,Michael,Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
14259,Jim, You have to stop this.
14260,Michael, Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
14261,Jim,I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
14262,Michael,"Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser..."
14263,Jim,Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
14264,Michael," Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real.  Stanley, are you having an affair?"
14265,Michael,"So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip."
14266,Michael,"I know, I know."
14267,Michael,"Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?"
14268,Michael,"Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool."
14269,Michael, I'm not saying... a damn thing.
14270,Michael, You can count on me.
14271,Michael," Oh, that smells good."
14272,Kevin,"I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat."
14273,Michael,Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
14274,Kevin,Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
14275,Michael,"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike."
14276,Michael,"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including ""Stanley is having an affair."" It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit."
14277,Erin,Kelly has an eating disorder?
14278,Erin,She always eats my lunch.
14279,Michael,Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
14280,Erin,We should do something.
14281,Michael,"Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess."
14282,Michael," I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here."
14283,Michael,Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
14284,Michael, Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
14285,Kevin," Oh, I bet you like it."
14286,Andy,Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
14287,Kevin,Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
14288,Andy, Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
14289,Andy,"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird.  Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course.  But it makes you wonder."
14290,Andy, Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
14291,Andy,Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
14292,Oscar,Are you attracted to other men?
14293,Andy," No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent,  I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like."
14294,Andy,"Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?"
14295,Oscar,"If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?"
14296,Andy,"It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario."
14297,Oscar,Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
14298,Oscar,What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
14299,Michael," Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go."
14300,Michael," Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors."
14301,Dwight," Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night."
14302,Dwight, Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
14303,Jim, You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
14304,Dwight,"Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right.  One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you  will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be."
14305,Erin, I am so happy you're eating again.
14306,Andy," Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?"
14307,Jim,"Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though."
14308,Jim,Are you... interested in her guy friends?
14309,Andy,"No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women."
14310,Andy,"But off the record, I'm kinda confused."
14311,Andy,"Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like..."
14312,Jim,Well you gotta figure this out.
14313,Jim,You gotta have s*x with a woman.
14314,Andy, Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
14315,Angela, Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a b*st*rd?
14316,Angela,Want me to say it again?
14317,Pam,Why did that come into your brain?
14318,Jim, Can I talk to you for a second?
14319,Pam,Who did you tell?
14320,Jim,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
14321,Oscar, What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
14322,Jim,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?"
14323,Michael," Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors."
14324,Jim,"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?"
14325,Michael,"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap."
14326,Pam,"Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning."
14327,Kevin,"I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?"
14328,Andy,I heard it from Erin.
14329,Erin,I heard it from Michael.
14330,Pam, Michael?  He's over here!
14331,Pam, Where are you going?
14332,Dwight,"Michael...  You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? "
14333,Pam,Don't get on it. 
14334,Pam,Don't... get... on. Do not.
14335,Michael," Okay, I made it all up."
14336,Andy,Even the fact that I'm gay?
14337,Michael,"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model."
14338,Angela,No. We heard that about Jim.
14339,Michael,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself."
14340,Angela,How is that a bad rumor?
14341,Michael,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit."
14342,Oscar,"Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog..."
14343,Michael,"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person."
14344,Andy,Michael... am I gay?
14345,Michael," The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that..."
14346,Kevin,"I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought ""Oh, she has a new bra with padding."" But then I thought ""Pam doesn't need padding."" It just didn't add up, Jim."
14347,Erin,"That's really great, you guys."
14348,Michael,"Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair."
14349,Jim," Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it."
14350,Jim,If everyone would like to see proof.
14351,Michael,Look at that!  That is the inside of your v*g1n*! 
14352,Pam, It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. 
14353,Michael, How long have you known about the pregnancy?
14354,Michael,A week? A month? A year?
14355,Jim,"Michael, we only told our parents last week."
14356,Michael,Did you pee on a stick?
14357,Jim,I did. It was inconclusive.
14358,Michael,You should've told me.
14359,Pam, You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
14360,Erin,"Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call."
14361,Pam, You called Stanley's wife?
14362,Michael,"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God."
14363,Michael,"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious."
14364,Pam,"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious."
14365,Michael,"No, no, I can do this."
14366,Jim,You can't do this.
14367,Michael,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over."
14368,Michael," Hey, what up, Cynthia? "
14369,Michael,"Hold on a second, Cynthia."
14370,Michael,"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess  and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try."
14371,Oscar,You wanted to see me?
14372,Michael,"Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me."
14373,Michael,I'm going in for a procedure today.
14374,Michael,"Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared."
14375,Oscar,"I'm sure everything will be fine.  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?"
14376,Michael,It is a colonoscopy.
14377,Michael,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?"
14378,Michael,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?"
14379,Michael,"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night."
14380,Michael,"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds."
14381,Michael,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  What's this about?"
14382,Jim,"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay."
14383,Michael,It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
14384,Michael,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out."
14385,Michael,"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting. "
14386,Michael,Hey let me escort you to your desk.
14387,Pam,"Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you."
14388,Michael,"You and Jim are close, huh?"
14389,Pam,"Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together."
14390,Michael,"Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you..."
14391,Pam,"Ummm, I don't know."
14392,Michael,"Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in."
14393,Pam,"Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious."
14394,Michael,"If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk."
14395,Pam,Please don't talk about my breast milk.
14396,Michael,I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?
14397,Michael,I just don't want you to.
14398,Darryl,"I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me."
14399,Dwight,"Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?"
14400,Darryl,"This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away."
14401,Dwight,"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden."
14402,Darryl,"If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare."
14403,Dwight,"Nnnnn, that's not... okay."
14404,Dwight,I'm talking about... hmmm.
14405,Dwight,"So long Darryl, feel better...  He's lying."
14406,Dwight,"Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders."
14407,Dwight,Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  Y'all having birthday cake?
14408,Dwight,Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
14409,Dwight,It just doesn't add up.
14410,Michael," Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye."
14411,Michael,Sorry about that. What'd I miss?
14412,Michael,"Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting.  Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes."
14413,Michael,"No, I think they're talking about me."
14414,Michael,"What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here."
14415,Pam,"Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine."
14416,Pam,"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet."
14417,Pam,"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work."
14418,Andy,What can I do for ya Hoss?
14419,Michael, How are your sales doin'?
14420,Andy,"How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer."
14421,Andy,"Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. ""Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha."""
14422,Michael,"Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?"
14423,Michael,Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
14424,Michael,"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant."
14425,Andy,"Oh, just backing up and turning around."
14426,Kevin,"Hey, we're gonna do this..."
14427,Andy,"Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you.  Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room."
14428,Andy,"Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit."
14429,Jim,"No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it."
14430,Erin,I think he's around here...
14431,Michael," Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?"
14432,Dwight,"Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched."
14433,Dwight,I have been my whole life.
14434,Dwight,I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
14435,Dwight,"Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime."
14436,Dwight,"Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming."
14437,Dwight,"Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!"
14438,Dwight,"Oh, worker's comp, my ass!"
14439,Dwight,Ooohhh...  Oh man! You okay?
14440,Pam,"So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding."
14441,Ryan,"Yeah, I might stop by."
14442,Pam,It costs about $75 per person.
14443,Ryan,"Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77."
14444,Pam,Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
14445,Ryan,"Yes, I'm coming to your wedding."
14446,Pam,"Okay, Ryan Howard, yes."
14447,Michael,Look who you're talking to.
14448,Michael,"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever."
14449,Michael, Permission to speak on the record?
14450,Michael,"Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe."
14451,Michael,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable."
14452,Michael,"It's not very well written, but you get the gist."
14453,Michael,I can just continue to run it myself.
14454,Michael,This was Jim's idea?
14455,Michael,"Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block."
14456,Jim,"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon."
14457,Michael, I can't help but feel partially responsible.
14458,Michael, Little pick me up?  Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush.
14459,Jim,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?"
14460,Michael,Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
14461,Jim,Why don't we head in your office to talk?
14462,Michael,"Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said..."
14463,Jim,"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed."
14464,Michael,"Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy."
14465,Jim,"Michael, did you say anything?"
14466,Michael,"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion."
14467,Jim,You will? Wanna do it right now?
14468,Jim,I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
14469,Dwight,I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.
14470,Darryl,Toby! Dwight! Is that them?
14471,Darryl,"You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food."
14472,Dwight,We thought that she was you.
14473,Darryl,Why would you think a lady is me?
14474,Dwight,Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
14475,Darryl,"Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you."
14476,Michael,"Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  Michael Scott here."
14477,Michael,Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
14478,Michael,"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him."
14479,Michael,"Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs."
14480,Dwight,Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
14481,Dwight,"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed."
14482,Darryl,Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
14483,Dwight,Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.
14484,Darryl,"Alright, yeah fine so whatever..."
14485,Dwight,"Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form."
14486,Darryl,And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
14487,Dwight,Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...
14488,Michael,"Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it."
14489,Jim,How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
14490,Michael,"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam,  and now I don't wanna lose the baby."
14491,Jim,"So instead, you screwed me?"
14492,Erin,David Wallace is calling.
14493,Michael,Kind of in the middle of something here.
14494,Erin,Should I tell him you'll call him back?
14495,Michael,"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both."
14496,Michael,"No, it's just us."
14497,Michael,"Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  Come in. "
14498,Michael,Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
14499,Jim,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool."
14500,Michael,"I like that, so manager and co-manager."
14501,Michael,Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
14502,Dwight,"Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed..."
14503,Michael,"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?"
14504,Dwight,I'm... I was making it.
14505,Michael,"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager."
14506,Michael,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts."
14507,Michael,"What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome."
14508,Pam,Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
14509,Pam,"Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging..."
14510,Pam,"You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding."
14511,Pam,To ask for directions..
14512,Pam,And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
14513,Pam," Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible."
14514,Angela,"Pam, my bag was there..."
14515,Dwight, Could you please sign my expense report?
14516,Michael,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic."
14517,Jim,"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the ""please""? We're not animals."
14518,Jim,"No, not without a ""please."""
14519,Dwight, I have a complaint about Jim.
14520,Michael,That is not big picture.
14521,Dwight,"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office."
14522,Dwight,Jim won't sign my expense report.
14523,Michael,That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
14524,Dwight,"No, that is huge."
14525,Michael,You're trying to trick me.
14526,Dwight,This has to do--
14527,Michael,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out."
14528,Dwight, I'd like to lodge a complaint.
14529,Jim,I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
14530,Jim,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
14531,Jim,Okay. And how do you feel?
14532,Jim,All right. Did he hit you?
14533,Jim,Did you feel like crying?
14534,Jim,"I'm just gonna write ""held back tears."""
14535,Dwight,"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true."
14536,Jim,"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it."
14537,Dwight,I'm not cr-- uhh!
14538,Dwight,"I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious!  Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!"
14539,Erin," Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down."
14540,Michael,"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while."
14541,Jim,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
14542,Michael,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?"
14543,Oscar,"Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?"
14544,Jim,I have noticed that we--
14545,Jim,Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
14546,Jim,"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--"
14547,Michael,"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important."
14548,Jim,"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics."
14549,Jim,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets."
14550,Michael,"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?"
14551,Michael,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets..."
14552,Michael,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are."
14553,Michael,"Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust."
14554,Jim,I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
14555,Michael,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea."
14556,Jim,You mean on a weekend?
14557,Jim,How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
14558,Michael,Alright. No more meetings this week.
14559,Jim,Really? You just agreed to that?
14560,Michael,I can be very suprising.
14561,Pam,"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant."
14562,Ryan,"You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight."
14563,Pam,"We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much."
14564,Pam,"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?"
14565,Jim," Okay, I thought I saw people missing."
14566,Michael,"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each."
14567,Jim,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?"
14568,Michael,"Stanley, you don't need to answer that."
14569,Jim,"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these."
14570,Michael,"What do you mean by ""these people""?"
14571,Jim,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting."
14572,Michael,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room."
14573,Jim,That's not what I meant.
14574,Michael,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want."
14575,Michael,What do you guys think? 
14576,Jim,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?"
14577,Michael,"No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people."
14578,Jim,"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager."
14579,Michael,That is not what Wallace told us.
14580,Jim,That's exactly what Wallace told us.
14581,Michael,That is not the way I heard it.
14582,Michael,"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around."
14583,Jim,"I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace."
14584,Michael,"No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace."
14585,Erin,David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
14586,Michael,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
14587,Jim,"Hey, David. You got Jim here."
14588,Michael,"Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager."
14589,Michael,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision."
14590,Jim,Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
14591,Michael,Which is it more of?
14592,Jim,"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work."
14593,Michael,I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
14594,Jim,"Nope, not at all."
14595,Michael,"No, it will not be. I am on top of it."
14596,Jim,"Alright, thanks alot, David."
14597,Michael,"Talk to you later--  Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this."
14598,Jim,You don't have to lie.
14599,Michael,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore."
14600,Michael,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
14601,Jim,Alright. Let's get started.
14602,Michael,"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it."
14603,Jim,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?"
14604,Michael,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim."
14605,Jim,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
14606,Michael,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?"
14607,Jim,It's hard to tell so far.
14608,Michael,You use your brain too much.
14609,Jim,"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?"
14610,Michael,Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
14611,Jim,You just came up with that.
14612,Michael,As I was saying it.
14613,Jim,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit."
14614,Michael, Con-- you look like a nerd.
14615,Jim,Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
14616,Michael,Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
14617,Michael,"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there."
14618,Jim,"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart--  How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it."
14619,Kevin,"Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where."
14620,Pam,I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
14621,Kevin,Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
14622,Kevin,Will you take a check?
14623,Kevin,"Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, ""To love's eternal glory."""
14624,Pam,"Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.  oh look! ""Mrs. Pam Halpert!"" That's the first time I've seen it in writing!"
14625,Jim,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen."
14626,Michael,That will not go over well.
14627,Jim,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us..."
14628,Michael,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself."
14629,Jim,I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
14630,Michael,"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue."
14631,Jim,"Look, you have a lot of strengths."
14632,Michael,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are."
14633,Jim,I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
14634,Michael,Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
14635,Jim,But there is a reason why I'm here!
14636,Michael,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
14637,Jim,"No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!"
14638,Michael,"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?"
14639,Jim,I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
14640,Jim,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision."
14641,Michael,"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!"
14642,Jim,"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table."
14643,Michael,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it."
14644,Michael, This had better be terrible.
14645,Jim,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff."
14646,Jim,"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults."
14647,Oscar,"Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people."
14648,Angela,"But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?"
14649,Oscar,"Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with."
14650,Jim,"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all."
14651,Jim,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office."
14652,Kevin,Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
14653,Oscar,"Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?"
14654,Dwight,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
14655,Jim,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--"
14656,Dwight,"What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!"
14657,Oscar,We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
14658,Angela,"Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!"
14659,Dwight,"Her kid needs shoes, Jim!"
14660,Jim,"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... "
14661,Michael,"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--"
14662,Angela,What are you talking about Michael?
14663,Michael,My plan-- a man-- panama.
14664,Andy,That's not how that goes.
14665,Oscar,"We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?"
14666,Michael,"Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do."
14667,Oscar,"Again, that gives us no information."
14668,Michael,What about a raise based on merit?
14669,Jim,Rank each person individually?
14670,Michael,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best."
14671,Jim," Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. "
14672,Michael,Are you making a--
14673,Jim,Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
14674,Kevin,"Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us."
14675,Angela,It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
14676,Dwight,I think it was Creed.
14677,Jim," It's going really well, actually."
14678,Jim," Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv-- who's that? "
14679,Jim,He's not a part of this. You know that.
14680,Michael,Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
14681,Michael,Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick?
14682,Michael,I... will skip a turn.
14683,Jim,"Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that."
14684,Michael,I need more time.
14685,Erin,Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. 
14686,Dwight,"People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly."
14687,Dwight,"Come on in.  That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces."
14688,Dwight,Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
14689,Michael,"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?"
14690,Kevin,What does a bean mean?
14691,Pam,"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?"
14692,Kevin,"Michael, what does a bean mean?"
14693,Jim,I was just trying to be unbiased.
14694,Kevin,What does a bean mean?!
14695,Oscar,Someone please explain it to Kevin.
14696,Angela,This is how you make this important decision?
14697,Andy,There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me.  That is ridiculous. This is how it works. 
14698,Andy,"Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise."
14699,Dwight,"Are we idiots?  What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!"
14700,Dwight,"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?  Okay."
14701,Kevin,What does a bean mean?
14702,Jim,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four."
14703,Michael,"Oh, what are you usually?"
14704,Michael,"Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero."
14705,Jim,"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?"
14706,Michael,"I know, I know."
14707,Jim,We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
14708,Michael,"Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. "
14709,Jim, Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
14710,Michael, Just pretend we're not here.
14711,Ryan,Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
14712,Pam,"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you."
14713,Ryan,"Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?"
14714,Pam,$100 now for sure.
14715,Ryan,"Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift..."
14716,Pam,"Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred."
14717,Ryan,"Instead of $5,000 a year from now?"
14718,Pam,How sure is this?
14719,Pam,The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
14720,Pam,"I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?"
14721,Jim,We would really appreciate it.
14722,Dwight,Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
14723,Pam,"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy."
14724,Dwight,"Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk."
14725,Pam,I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
14726,Andy, Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow... 
14727,Michael, What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
14728,Jim,It is really special.
14729,Pam,"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great."
14730,Michael,It's just a really important day for me.
14731,Erin,"Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day."
14732,Jim,"Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column."
14733,Kevin,"So... you're going to provide them, then?"
14734,Jim,No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
14735,Dwight,Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
14736,Pam,Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
14737,Jim,Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
14738,Angela,Decent people everywhere will get offended.
14739,Pam,"Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned."
14740,Angela,"Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers."
14741,Pam,"You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding."
14742,Michael,Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. 
14743,Angela,Ow! He pinched me!
14744,Pam,Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
14745,Michael,"And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara."
14746,Andy,"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. "
14747,Michael,Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
14748,Andy,No... I didn't steal your joke.
14749,Michael,Yes. I said that yesterday.
14750,Dwight,But you can say that about anything.
14751,Dwight,"What happens in accounting, stays in accounting."
14752,Michael,"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke."
14753,Dwight,It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
14754,Michael,"This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!"
14755,Michael,Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
14756,Dwight,I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
14757,Michael,Get out of here.
14758,Michael,"Oh, my God, Dwight."
14759,Dwight,"For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster."
14760,Dwight,Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
14761,Michael,"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn."
14762,Dwight,Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
14763,Dwight,"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike."
14764,Michael,Is that all you have on her?
14765,Dwight,"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name."
14766,Kevin,"People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair.  It's the hair--  Ok. Ok. I'm going.  God."
14767,Andy," Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know."
14768,Erin,Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
14769,Andy,Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
14770,Pam," Hey, my aunt told me something neat."
14771,Pam,She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
14772,Jim,"Oh, wow. That's cool."
14773,Jim," Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever."
14774,Pam,We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
14775,Michael, Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
14776,Michael,Those glasses are super dark.
14777,Michael,"Alright. We need some tunes, I think."
14778,Dwight,You know what? I made you a cd...
14779,Michael,That was nice of you.
14780,Dwight,This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
14781,Michael,"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in."
14782,Dwight,"You're gonna like this.  ""Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--"" "
14783,Michael,Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
14784,Michael,No. No. That's not how it works.
14785,Jim,"Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun."
14786,Jim,And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
14787,Jim,"I know. We're pretty excited, too."
14788,Pam,Can we take a look at the suite now?
14789,Pam,Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
14790,Andy,Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. 
14791,Jim,I don't like that.
14792,Pam,"I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please."
14793,Michael,Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
14794,Dwight,The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
14795,Michael,I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
14796,Dwight,Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
14797,Dwight,And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
14798,Michael,"Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room."
14799,Dwight,No way. What if I meet someone?
14800,Michael,"I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight."
14801,Michael,I would do the same for you.
14802,Dwight,"Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours."
14803,Dwight,"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?"
14804,Michael,Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
14805,Michael,"If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay."
14806,Dwight,Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
14807,Michael,I don't have a room?
14808,Dwight,No you do not.
14809,Michael,Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
14810,Michael,"When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet."
14811,Michael,Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
14812,Michael,Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
14813,Michael,You... are... kidding me.
14814,Michael,"I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?"
14815,Michael,"You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it."
14816,Pam,"Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles."
14817,Jim,"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?"
14818,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word."
14819,Jim,"Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott."
14820,Michael,Nice to meet you.
14821,Michael,Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
14822,Jim,"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think."
14823,Michael,That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
14824,Jim,Pretty sure everyone heard that.
14825,Michael,Didn't move my lips.
14826,Pam,Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
14827,Jim,Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
14828,Jim,"Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?"
14829,Dwight,"From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report."
14830,Dwight,"Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt."
14831,Dwight,That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
14832,Pam,"Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor."
14833,Oscar,Pleased to meet you.
14834,Kevin,She thought I was your boyfriend.
14835,Oscar,You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
14836,Pam,"Oscar, it was an honest mistake."
14837,Kevin,"Oscar, I would be proud to date you."
14838,Kevin,I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
14839,Oscar,You owe me and apology.
14840,Kevin,Are you seeing anyone right now?
14841,Pam,She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
14842,Ryan, I was the youngest VP in the company history.
14843,Andy,How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
14844,Kevin,She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
14845,Andy,What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
14846,Michael,"Head table, where I belong."
14847,Dwight,It's just for family.
14848,Michael,"Well, who's that one?"
14849,Dwight,"Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her.  In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2."
14850,Michael,"What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?"
14851,Dwight,That's a very good record.
14852,Michael,"They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom."
14853,Michael,"That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider."
14854,Michael,That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
14855,Michael,"That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. "
14856,Michael,And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
14857,Jim,"Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming."
14858,Jim,"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?"
14859,Jim,"I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--"
14860,Jim,"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant."
14861,Michael," Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--"
14862,Michael,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation."
14863,Michael,"When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation."
14864,Jim,"Oh, my God. Please."
14865,Michael,When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
14866,Michael,...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
14867,Michael,"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word."
14868,Michael,That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
14869,Jim,I can't believe it was me.
14870,Michael,"I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me."
14871,Jim,Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
14872,Michael,I have not found that to be the case.
14873,Michael,"Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me."
14874,Pam,Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
14875,Jim,"Oh, my God. Are you serious?"
14876,Michael,There's gonna be a free room?
14877,Michael,"Hi, Mema. It's Michael."
14878,Michael,Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
14879,Michael,"I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody."
14880,Michael,"Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. "
14881,Michael,"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have s*x before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have s*x and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life."
14882,Michael,"They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema."
14883,Michael,"Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio."
14884,Andy,"Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models."
14885,Kevin,That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
14886,Andy,Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
14887,Andy,No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
14888,Andy,"If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come."
14889,Angela,And where do you think you're going?
14890,Pam,I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
14891,Angela,"Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?"
14892,Pam,I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
14893,Angela,Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
14894,Michael,What are you wearing?
14895,Dwight,"What? It's a casual, social outfit."
14896,Michael,"Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight."
14897,Dwight,No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during s*x.
14898,Michael,"Ok.  That's not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. "
14899,Kevin,It's a good idea.
14900,Oscar,It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
14901,Kevin,"Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice."
14902,Dwight,"I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself."
14903,Michael,"Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm."
14904,Dwight,"I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'."
14905,Michael," Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar."
14906,Dwight,Drop this one. Abort.
14907,Michael,"Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you."
14908,Dwight,I love finding a good set of twins.
14909,Michael,Something is wrong with you.
14910,Erin, Go Meredith. Nice moves.
14911,Andy,"You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this."
14912,Andy,How about a little bit of this.
14913,Erin,Oh yeah. What else you got?
14914,Kevin,What else you got?
14915,Andy,Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! 
14916,Erin,What else you got?
14917,Kevin,It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here.  Pam? 
14918,Andy,I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
14919,Andy,I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
14920,Pam,"Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours."
14921,Andy,Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.
14922,Pam," Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?"
14923,Pam,He tore his scrotum dancing.
14924,Pam,He is in my room icing his balls.
14925,Pam,Please stop saying what. Can you take him?
14926,Jim,"Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted."
14927,Pam,Your brothers took you out drinking?
14928,Michael," Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly."
14929,Pam,That's Michael. You're out with Michael?
14930,Jim,"Pam, it just happened."
14931,Pam,"Okay, fine. I'll take him."
14932,Jim,"I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!"
14933,Pam,Are you pushing me off the phone?
14934,Jim,No. Let's talk for a long time.
14935,Michael,Mmm! It's after midnight. 
14936,Jim,That's not how that works.
14937,Michael,Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
14938,Dwight,You'll have Pam to answer to.
14939,Michael,"She'll be sitting home saying, ""Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.""  ""And... and clip my toenails."""
14940,Dwight,"""Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."""
14941,Michael,Now you sound like Kermit.
14942,Andy,Are you sure this is the right way?
14943,Pam,"Nope. I, like you, have never been here before."
14944,Andy,"Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum."
14945,Pam,"Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before."
14946,Andy,I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--
14947,Pam,My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job.
14948,Andy,"Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--"
14949,Andy, I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
14950,Pam,"Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?"
14951,Andy,No. No that was real.
14952,Michael, Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?
14953,Kevin,"I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet."
14954,Kevin,But that was my only pair of shoes.
14955,Dwight,"It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel."
14956,Dwight,"Okay, get out of here."
14957,Michael," Hey, good morning.  It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit."
14958,Dwight, Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.
14959,Michael, How can you eat like that?
14960,Dwight,I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?
14961,Michael,"Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself."
14962,Dwight,"Hey, what was she like?"
14963,Michael,She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.
14964,Dwight,Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?
14965,Michael,She was from Europe.
14966,Dwight,I bet she had hairy armpits.
14967,Dwight,"Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere."
14968,Michael,Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
14969,Michael,She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
14970,Dwight,Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.
14971,Dwight,Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.
14972,Michael,She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--
14973,Dwight,You should ask her out.
14974,Michael, I already have my European girlfriend.
14975,Erin,Are you in a lot of pain?
14976,Andy,Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.
14977,Erin,People say you cry all the time.
14978,Andy,I wasn't telling you.
14979,Andy,"No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that?"
14980,Jim,I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.
14981,Erin,If you want to sit on this--  I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged pen1s. Make it softer.
14982,Andy,"It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you."
14983,Michael,"Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me."
14984,Dwight,"I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs."
14985,Pam,"Okay, here I come. "
14986,Pam,"Yes. Thank you, mom."
14987,Pam,"Okay great.  Yeah, I'll see you in a second.  Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no!"
14988,Pam,Can you come here please?
14989,Pam,"No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here."
14990,Dwight, That was an intelligent comment.
14991,Dwight,"Oh. Fine. Isabel,  nice to see you. What do you want?"
14992,Dwight," So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement."
14993,Michael," Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?"
14994,Michael,"Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?"
14995,Pam,My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
14996,Jim," Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty."
14997,Jim,"And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?"
14998,Pam,"No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- "
14999,Jim,There. Now we're even. 
15000,Pam, Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?
15001,Oscar, What are you doing?
15002,Kevin,I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
15003,Oscar,How long do you take to pee?
15004,Kevin,"The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on."
15005,Michael, Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--
15006,Michael,Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
15007,Michael,Oh... okay. Were you saving it?
15008,Michael,I'm sorry.  Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.
15009,Erin,Do you think they canceled the wedding?
15010,Angela,Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
15011,Michael,my weekend was bad so far.
15012,Michael,"I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm."
15013,Michael,And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
15014,Michael,It is a terrible year for love.
15015,Michael,I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
15016,Michael,"Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually.  There you go. Use it in good health."
15017,Kevin,"Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?"
15018,Kevin,Who would want it?
15019,Oscar,"Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes."
15020,Dwight,I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
15021,Dwight, Crap.  Come here you.
15022,Ryan,Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
15023,Jim,"Well we are here now, so let's just--"
15024,Michael, Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?
15025,Pam, Go ahead. I think it's your turn.
15026,Michael,"Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube."
15027,Jim,"I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her."
15028,Kevin,"What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel."
15029,Michael,"The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. ""Mental"" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it."
15030,Michael,"Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need ""small talk."" What topics can you use for small talk?"
15031,Michael,"Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, ""So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"""
15032,Michael,"Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with."
15033,Michael," The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman..."
15034,Erin," Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to."
15035,Michael,"Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?"
15036,Erin,"In your schedule it just says nine til noon is ""creative space"" and I thought this could be part of that."
15037,Michael,Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
15038,Erin,"You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says ""free play."""
15039,Michael,Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
15040,Michael,Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
15041,Michael,"There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player."
15042,Kevin,Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
15043,Andy,What do you think?
15044,Dwight,I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
15045,Michael,"Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up."
15046,Michael,"Mmhm, I hear you. The truck."
15047,Andy,What happened in there?
15048,Michael,"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman."
15049,Dwight,Did he threaten you?
15050,Michael,"No Dwight, not everything is a threat."
15051,Michael,There is no such things as monsters.
15052,Andy,He drives an SUV!
15053,Dwight,"I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space."
15054,Oscar,"Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?"
15055,Dwight,"No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster."
15056,Michael,"Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance."
15057,Andy,"All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation."
15058,Oscar,"For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia."
15059,Michael,"I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance."
15060,Andy,"Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!"
15061,Michael,He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
15062,Oscar,"Uhh. All right, who else is here? "
15063,Oscar,"Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between ""sane and others."" Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The ""coalition for reason"" is extremely weak."
15064,Michael," Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?"
15065,Ryan,"Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'"
15066,Ryan,What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
15067,Michael,"Um it is, Grotti."
15068,Andy,"It's John Gotti, you idiot!"
15069,Oscar,"It's, it's a completely different name!"
15070,Andy,Yeah. It's pretty close.
15071,Oscar,"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it."
15072,Dwight,"No I disagree. ""R"" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it ""murder."" And not ""muck-duck."""
15073,Michael,Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
15074,Michael,I'm not gonna lock my door. 
15075,Oscar,Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
15076,Jim,"Oscar! Uh, what is going on?"
15077,Oscar,"It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this."
15078,Jim,"Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-"
15079,Pam,Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
15080,Pam,"Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us."
15081,Oscar,"You're right. You're right.  Oh, okay bye."
15082,Michael,It's Grotti. He's following up.
15083,Andy,"Already? This, this guy is persistent!"
15084,Michael," ""I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."""
15085,Michael,"Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?"
15086,Andy,Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
15087,Michael,"Okay, I'm calling the police."
15088,Andy, That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
15089,Dwight,He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
15090,Andy,"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!"
15091,Michael,That's not gonna happen.
15092,Andy,That's how it works!
15093,Michael,What am I supposed to do here?
15094,Andy,"When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back"
15095,Michael,I was thinking exactly the same thing.
15096,Dwight,"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat."
15097,Dwight,"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people."
15098,Michael,"I don't know, I don't know about that."
15099,Andy,"Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting."
15100,Dwight,"Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent."
15101,Dwight,Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
15102,Andy, I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
15103,Michael,"Hold on, hold on! Just-"
15104,Andy,"No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way."
15105,Michael,"All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone."
15106,Andy,Well you're gonna have to.  Dwight: We'll be right beside you.
15107,Michael, What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
15108,Andy,"Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing."
15109,Dwight,Do you know how to use it?
15110,Andy,"To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it."
15111,Michael,"Let's go, come on.  God!"
15112,Michael,Forget it! Forget it!
15113,Michael, Take that thing off the table! Please!
15114,Andy,Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
15115,Dwight,Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
15116,Dwight,You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
15117,Michael,"Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is."
15118,Michael,Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
15119,Kevin,"Oh man, do you think it was stolen?"
15120,Kevin,"Um, yes.  Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA"
15121,Kevin,Wait a minute. Yes I am.
15122,Kevin,"No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer."
15123,Dwight,Oh he's not that nice.
15124,Michael,I will have the gabba-gool.
15125,Michael,"I don't, I don't have to have that."
15126,Dwight,"What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool."
15127,Dwight,Bring him the gabba-gool!
15128,Michael,"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad."
15129,Michael,"If the salad is on top, I send it back."
15130,Oscar,Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
15131,Kevin,"I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone."
15132,Oscar,This constitutes identity fraud.
15133,Kevin,Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
15134,Oscar,What's that supposed to mean?
15135,Kevin,Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.
15136,Oscar,Why would I love jail?
15137,Kevin,Because... You would love it.
15138,Michael,I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
15139,Andy,Maybe we have a plan for you?
15140,Michael,"No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad."
15141,Michael,"Hey, do you need any help?"
15142,Michael,He's a good mechanic.
15143,Dwight,He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
15144,Andy,"Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down."
15145,Andy,You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store.  Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube.
15146,Andy,"So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. "
15147,Andy,"Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of."
15148,Andy,"It was before, my tech- my technical training."
15149,Dwight,"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?"
15150,Michael,It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
15151,Andy,"You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you."
15152,Michael,I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
15153,Dwight,"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour."
15154,Michael,It was a lot of snap decisions.
15155,Dwight,"Do you know what ""snap decision"" means?"
15156,Dwight,It means like this. 
15157,Michael,Just get in the car.
15158,Jim,"How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran."
15159,Michael,"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier."
15160,Michael,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend."
15161,Jim,I'm gonna help you through it all right?
15162,Jim,All you're gonna need to  and- it- and then go to--
15163,Jim,And then you'll be saved.
15164,Michael,"What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said."
15165,Jim,Just  and then you'll be saved.
15166,Michael,"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!"
15167,Michael,No! Oh my God!
15168,Jim,And you'll be saved.
15169,Michael,"No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!"
15170,Jim,I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.
15171,Michael,Jim?!?  Oh my God.
15172,Michael,"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?"
15173,Oscar,"Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it."
15174,Michael,Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
15175,Michael,"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks."
15176,Dwight,"We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault."
15177,Andy,He's alive. So you're welcome.
15178,Dwight,"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job."
15179,Andy,"Yeah, some of that existed before."
15180,Dwight,"Not the living in fear, that's new."
15181,Andy,"You're right, that is new."
15182,Dwight,Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
15183,Andy,Well I don't see that happening.
15184,Dwight,Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
15185,Andy,That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
15186,Dwight,What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
15187,Andy,That seems a little far-fetched.
15188,Dwight,Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.
15189,Dwight,Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
15190,Michael,No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
15191,Andy,"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean."
15192,Dwight,"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really."
15193,Andy,Class act. Boy scout.
15194,Michael,But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
15195,Andy,He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
15196,Dwight,And he made us all look like chumps!
15197,Michael,"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden."
15198,Michael,Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
15199,Michael,Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
15200,Michael,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance."
15201,Michael,I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
15202,Michael,And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
15203,Dwight,"That's good, let's wrap it up."
15204,Michael,"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?"
15205,Michael,What a tool.  What?
15206,Andy,"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!"
15207,Michael,No. What do you mean?
15208,Dwight,"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared."
15209,Dwight,You successfully backed down the mob!
15210,Andy,You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
15211,Michael,Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
15212,Michael,"So I looked him in the eye and I said, ""Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead."" I said something like that."
15213,Oscar,"Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg."
15214,Michael,"Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back."
15215,Michael,Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
15216,Erin,How do you return coffee?
15217,Pam, Are you kidding me?
15218,Kevin,"Hi Pam, is Jim there?"
15219,Pam,"Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!"
15220,Kevin,"Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi."
15221,Pam,Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
15222,Kevin,They have no idea what happened.
15223,Kevin,Oooh yeah...  Jim and Pam!
15224,Jim,Puerto Rico was awesome.
15225,Pam,"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot."
15226,Jim, Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh.
15227,Michael,"Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?"
15228,Michael,Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
15229,Dwight,"Its Jim and Pam, Michael."
15230,Michael,"They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! "
15231,Michael,"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy."
15232,Michael,Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. 
15233,Pam,It's good to be home.
15234,Dwight,This conversation has two items on the agenda.
15235,Jim,Do we have a conversation scheduled?
15236,Dwight,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say...  con-quack-ulations!"
15237,Jim,"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you."
15238,Dwight,"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing."
15239,Dwight,I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
15240,Jim,It's a real handsome duck.
15241,Dwight,"Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair."
15242,Pam,"Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy."
15243,Erin,Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
15244,Pam,Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
15245,Erin,"Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first."
15246,Pam, I think it'll be okay.
15247,Erin," I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though."
15248,Michael,I have recently taken a lover.
15249,Jim,"Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?"
15250,Michael,"Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?"
15251,Jim,You're messing with me.
15252,Jim,You did not have s*x with Pam's mom.
15253,Jim,What kind of car does she drive?
15254,Michael,She drives a green camry.
15255,Michael,And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
15256,Jim,Oh my God.  Oh my God.
15257,Jim,"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-"
15258,Michael,"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?"
15259,Jim,"Not now, Toby, my God!"
15260,Michael,"Get the hell out of here, idiot."
15261,Jim,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again."
15262,Michael,"I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy."
15263,Jim,"No, not more than anything."
15264,Michael,"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-"
15265,Jim,"Don't call her ""the mom."""
15266,Michael,She's right on my way home from work.
15267,Jim,"Then take a different way home, man!"
15268,Michael,"I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam."
15269,Jim,"Okay, so we're good."
15270,Michael,Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
15271,Erin,"Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?"
15272,Michael,Sure. Thanks for asking.
15273,Erin,"Pam, we're all set.  Yum."
15274,Pam,"Frank and beans!  So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?"
15275,Jim,You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
15276,Pam,"Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we?"
15277,Jim,"You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy."
15278,Pam,"Come on, it'll take two seconds."
15279,Michael,That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
15280,Erin,"Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people."
15281,Pam,"Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion."
15282,Michael,"Yeah, no, it's nobody."
15283,Pam, I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
15284,Pam, I think you have a date.
15285,Jim,"Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it."
15286,Michael," I don't deserve this, guys."
15287,Jim,Just take the parrot.
15288,Jim,"Okay, back to the old grind."
15289,Michael,I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
15290,Pam,"Oh, that's too bad."
15291,Michael,"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here."
15292,Pam,"Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes."
15293,Michael,You want me to be happy?
15294,Michael,"Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine."
15295,Michael,"More than a friend, a co-worker."
15296,Pam,"Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?"
15297,Pam,"No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!"
15298,Michael,"That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset."
15299,Dwight," You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?"
15300,Dwight,"There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down..."
15301,Dwight,There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
15302,Michael,"I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner."
15303,Dwight,"...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine."
15304,Pam," How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!"
15305,Jim, Who wants a hot chocolate?
15306,Jim," Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure."
15307,Pam,You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
15308,Jim,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?"
15309,Andy,"Sure thing, Tuna Boss."
15310,Andy, How may I be of service to you?
15311,Jim,"I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?"
15312,Andy, This aurea is a joke.
15313,Andy,What are you thinking?
15314,Jim,I was gonna go with this one.
15315,Andy," Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better."
15316,Dwight, The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
15317,Dwight,What were you talking about in there?
15318,Andy,Trust me it would only make you mad. 
15319,Michael," Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities."
15320,Andy,Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
15321,Michael,"That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own."
15322,Pam,Haha! Ha ha ha.
15323,Jim,And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice. 
15324,Michael,"Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  Alright, good."
15325,Dwight,Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
15326,Pam,"I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it. "
15327,Michael,"Okay, I'm out of here,  see you later guys..."
15328,Michael,"Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation..."
15329,Pam,"I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.  No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! "
15330,Michael,Anybody else? Who else has an idea?
15331,Angela,I have some ideas about conservation...
15332,Michael, Can you hold down the fort?  Hey boo!
15333,Angela,Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
15334,Michael, What's it... why are you crying?
15335,Jim,Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder...
15336,Angela,"Well, for our profit..."
15337,Michael," No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle."
15338,Michael," Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now."
15339,Angela,"I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor."
15340,Oscar,"Hold on, hold on, what's going on?"
15341,Jim,Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
15342,Pam,I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology.
15343,Michael,For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
15344,Pam,Don't call my mother your lover.
15345,Kevin,Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
15346,Andy,That is not okay dude.
15347,Michael,"Alright, in my defense..."
15348,Pam,"Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!"
15349,Oscar,You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
15350,Michael,"Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness."
15351,Oscar,"Maybe you're right, who are we to..."
15352,Pam,"Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!"
15353,Dwight,I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
15354,Michael,Let's get back to the matter at hand.
15355,Pam,"Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom..."
15356,Michael,"No, no, no... no, no..."
15357,Ryan,"Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about..."
15358,Michael,"I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it."
15359,Pam,"Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!"
15360,Michael,"Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out."
15361,Pam,"You are never going to be my father, you get out!"
15362,Michael,"I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am..."
15363,Angela," Pam, how's your day going?"
15364,Oscar,"Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions."
15365,Pam,"Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?"
15366,Oscar,My mother's in a wheelchair.
15367,Pam,"Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page."
15368,Ryan,"Ahh, I don't think so, no..."
15369,Ryan,I'd rather not say.
15370,Ryan, ...it should go with the persona you already have.
15371,Dwight,Where did you get that mallard?
15372,Dwight,"Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back."
15373,Dwight, I'll give you five bucks for it.
15374,Ryan,"This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas."
15375,Michael," Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?"
15376,Michael,"Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry."
15377,Michael,Can I sit down for a second?
15378,Michael,"This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation."
15379,Michael,She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
15380,Michael,Really? Would you do that?
15381,Michael," You're a good, good guy."
15382,Pam," What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?"
15383,Pam," Oh, would that make you feel better?"
15384,Michael,I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
15385,Pam,You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
15386,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it."
15387,Pam,"Michael, you're just her rebound!"
15388,Michael,"You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her."
15389,Jim,"Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean..."
15390,Michael," Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will."
15391,Michael,"Well, that is not gonna happen!"
15392,Pam,Then why'd you even offer!?
15393,Michael,Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
15394,Pam,"Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!"
15395,Michael,You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
15396,Pam,What's that supposed to mean?
15397,Michael,You know what it means.
15398,Michael,"I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week."
15399,Jim," Dwight, you brought the mallard back."
15400,Dwight,"Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even..."
15401,Dwight,Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
15402,Jim,"Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage..."
15403,Dwight,"Oh, I'm equipped... I can..."
15404,Jim,"I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car."
15405,Dwight,"Punishment fits the crime, I accept. "
15406,Michael," Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum."
15407,Jim," Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car."
15408,Pam," Awww, he did that for me?"
15409,Jim,"Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay."
15410,Jim, Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
15411,Pam,"Haha, yeah. Say more nice things."
15412,Jim,"Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!"
15413,Pam,But I don't think I am.
15414,Jim,"You're not, nope. Nope."
15415,Kevin, Oh... where'd you get that hat?
15416,Ryan,I'd rather not say.
15417,Dwight,"  ""We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...""  I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane.  ""...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."""
15418,Michael,Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
15419,Michael,Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  ... ha ha ha.
15420,Jim,"We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company."
15421,Michael,I am going to scare these kids so bad.
15422,Darryl,"This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look.  Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim."
15423,Darryl,"Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get."
15424,Ryan,That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
15425,Darryl,Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
15426,Darryl,I asked for a list.  ...and a clown.
15427,Darryl,"You're not as scary as Book Face, over there."
15428,Jim,Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
15429,Darryl,"Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!"
15430,Michael,"Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?"
15431,Michael,Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
15432,Michael,It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
15433,Darryl,What the hell is wrong with you?
15434,Michael,...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
15435,Michael,Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
15436,Jim,I bet we would.
15437,Michael,They have a TCBY booth.
15438,Michael,The same stuff you get downtown.
15439,Michael,Do you like TCBY?
15440,Michael,I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
15441,Erin,I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
15442,Jim,"Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me."
15443,Erin,They said the both of you.
15444,Jim,That is a mistake.
15445,Michael,You should give them a call. Check that out.
15446,Jim,"Alright. Let's clear this up.  Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?"
15447,Michael,"Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?"
15448,Jim,Great. See ya' then.
15449,Jim,They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
15450,Michael,"Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand."
15451,Jim,"I absolutely don't understand, either."
15452,Michael,"I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright."
15453,Michael,Let me get your stroller.
15454,Jim,"Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?"
15455,Michael,What are you gonna call him?
15456,Michael,No. What is his name?
15457,Michael,Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
15458,Jim,Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
15459,Michael,"Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?"
15460,Michael,...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
15461,Michael,They are into style.
15462,Michael,They are into appearance. We are selling success.
15463,Jim,He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
15464,Pam,Here we are outside-
15465,Andy,Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.
15466,Pam,The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
15467,Andy, Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
15468,Pam,Here it is.  Suite 401.
15469,Andy,Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
15470,Pam,I know. Now you don't have to.
15471,Andy,"Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling.  Suite 401."
15472,Michael,Alright. Hi. Any messages?
15473,Michael,"Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning."
15474,Michael,It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
15475,Angela,Why isn't Jim wet?
15476,Dwight,"Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?"
15477,Jim,I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
15478,Andy,We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. 
15479,Pam," Oh. No, no.  We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together."
15480,Andy, Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
15481,Erin," Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond."
15482,Erin,"Michael, people are asking questions."
15483,Michael,"Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?"
15484,Michael,Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
15485,Oscar,"Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?"
15486,Jim,Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
15487,Michael,It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
15488,Angela,So you fell in?
15489,Michael,No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
15490,Angela,So a child had fallen in?
15491,Michael,"No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. "
15492,Jim,"Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out."
15493,Pam,And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
15494,Andy,"Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not."
15495,Andy,"Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine."
15496,Pam,"Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes."
15497,Andy,"Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like."
15498,Pam,You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
15499,Andy,No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
15500,Pam,"You blew the sale, you idiot."
15501,Andy,Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
15502,Michael,"Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?"
15503,Erin,"Staples?  Uh, David Wallace called."
15504,Michael,Oh. He did? What did he say?
15505,Erin,"He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it."
15506,Kevin, I'm gonna kill you.
15507,Dwight,A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
15508,Michael,"I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story."
15509,Oscar,Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
15510,Dwight,"Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -"
15511,Michael,I know what a flounder is.
15512,Michael,I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
15513,Michael,The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
15514,Kevin,Yeah. Every single day.
15515,Michael,You never said anything.
15516,Michael,"Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'"
15517,Angela,That's never the case.
15518,Michael,"We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on."
15519,Dwight,I don't want people making fun of my nose.
15520,Oscar,Oh my. That is small.
15521,Dwight,"Just, write it down, please."
15522,Oscar,Can you breathe okay?
15523,Dwight,"Hey! It's on the list, everybody."
15524,Michael,No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
15525,Kevin,I don't want people making fun of my weight.
15526,Michael,Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
15527,Michael,Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
15528,Andy,That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
15529,Andy,Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
15530,Pam,He loves to eat.
15531,Andy,I love to dance-
15532,Pam,I love to watch him dance.
15533,Andy,Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
15534,Pam,And I'll just watch him.
15535,Andy,Yeah. We are thrilled.
15536,Andy,"In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?"
15537,Andy,Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
15538,Angela,"This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel."
15539,Erin,"Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. "
15540,Erin,They want you to pay for it.
15541,Michael,It could've died of natural causes. So...
15542,Erin,"Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer."
15543,Oscar,When is the funeral?
15544,Michael,"Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?"
15545,Michael,What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
15546,Jim,"Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it."
15547,Michael,No. We are not done here. This-
15548,Andy,"One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!"
15549,Andy,"Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me."
15550,Pam,"Yeah, well, that'll happen."
15551,Andy,"Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. "
15552,Pam,Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
15553,Andy,"Message received, little soy bean."
15554,Jim,"I think you just gotta ride this one out, man."
15555,Michael,"No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'."
15556,Michael,"Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail."
15557,Jim,Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
15558,Michael,I want to make fun of you right now.
15559,Jim,"Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball."
15560,Michael,No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
15561,Michael,"Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much?  Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to."
15562,Michael,"Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem."
15563,Dwight,"Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself."
15564,Michael,"It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice."
15565,Kevin,I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
15566,Michael,Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
15567,Jim,"Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so..."
15568,Andy,"Well, that went pretty well."
15569,Andy,"We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it."
15570,Pam,"If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss."
15571,Andy,You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
15572,Pam,Yeah. Way too much.
15573,Pam,"I mean, what the hell was that?"
15574,Andy,What the heck was that?
15575,Andy,"Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy."
15576,Pam,You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
15577,Andy,"No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?"
15578,Andy,"I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single."
15579,Pam,"Well, are you dating anyone?"
15580,Andy,What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
15581,Andy,You think I can do better?
15582,Andy,Gotta get my goin' out on.
15583,Jim,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this."
15584,Oscar,How can we not watch this?
15585,Jim,What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
15586,Jim,That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
15587,Michael,Is this the tape of me falling?
15588,Oscar,It starts on it's own. Let it -
15589,Kevin,No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
15590,Jim,Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
15591,Michael,No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
15592,Jim,What are you doing?
15593,Michael,It's alright. I can handle it.
15594,Michael,"I am a grown-up, Jim."
15595,Kevin,Here they come.  Boom!
15596,Oscar,Oh. Did - did you see that?
15597,Angela,Why'd you stop it?
15598,Jim,"Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it."
15599,Oscar,"Jim, you let Michael fall in."
15600,Dwight,Play it again.  He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
15601,Jim,Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
15602,Michael,I don't think you froze.
15603,Jim,It's a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office?
15604,Jim,I didn't ask you.  Would you like to talk? 
15605,Dwight,"Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-"
15606,Jim,"I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job."
15607,Michael,Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
15608,Oscar,"Jim, I think I'm in your way. "
15609,Michael,"No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. "
15610,Michael,You're welcome. Whoa!  Almost fell. 
15611,Pam,"Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?"
15612,Erin,"Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them."
15613,Erin,"How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?"
15614,Pam,"No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool."
15615,Erin,"He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met."
15616,Pam,That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.
15617,Erin,Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
15618,Pam,I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
15619,Dwight,Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?
15620,Dwight,"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you."
15621,Andy,Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
15622,Dwight,"Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?"
15623,Dwight,"Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one."
15624,Michael,No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
15625,Dwight,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
15626,Dwight,You're thinking of deer pen1s.
15627,Dwight,Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  Bagel?
15628,Michael,I don't mind if I do.
15629,Dwight,K. I brought cheese too.
15630,Michael,I'm taking one for my lady friend.
15631,Michael,Brain food. Thank you very much.
15632,Dwight,Okay.  You owe me.
15633,Dwight,Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?
15634,Dwight,"Pam, would you care for a bagel?"
15635,Pam,"Oh, no thank you."
15636,Dwight,"That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel."
15637,Pam,I have an early lunch.
15638,Pam,"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out."
15639,Erin,These are amazing. You took all these?
15640,Ryan,I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?
15641,Erin,Oh just by like friends.
15642,Ryan,Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
15643,Pam,Hey!  Hey. Happy birthday.
15644,Michael, My girls. There they are. 
15645,Michael,"Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your ""Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother"" and fixes all occurrences of ""I don't really see them together"". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food."
15646,Angela,"Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?"
15647,Pam,I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
15648,Michael,I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?
15649,Michael,"No, that wouldn't be--"
15650,Michael,Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
15651,Michael,"Please, Kevin. You're fired.  Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?"
15652,Erin,"Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent."
15653,Pam,"Oh, you guys. Just one second.  Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch."
15654,Jim,"Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too."
15655,Pam,I know. Isn't that always how it goes?
15656,Jim,Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.
15657,Pam,I want to handle it.
15658,Pam,I feel like its--
15659,Jim,It's my pleasure.  Hello? Well that's great.  Turns out the paper was there all along.
15660,Jim,Pam's sales are fine actually.
15661,Michael,"Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today."
15662,Michael,Today is about family.
15663,Pam,Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
15664,Andy,"Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you."
15665,Dwight,Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
15666,Andy,"Yes!  And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory."
15667,Andy,Feel it against your cheek.
15668,Andy,You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness.
15669,Dwight,Let me get that door for you-- 
15670,Andy,Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you. 
15671,Dwight,"Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees."
15672,Dwight,"Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay."
15673,Andy,"Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus."
15674,Dwight, And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
15675,Andy,Whoa-- thank you very much.  Oh boy.
15676,Dwight,Thank you very much for that.
15677,Andy, You are very welcome.
15678,Dwight, Have a seat. Allow me.
15679,Andy, Have a seat yourself.
15680,Dwight,You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
15681,Andy,You didn't have to do that.
15682,Dwight,Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.
15683,Michael,Hello. Scott. Table for four.
15684,Pam,"I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too."
15685,Michael,What table should we take? So many to choose from.
15686,Michael,"What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!"
15687,Pam,"Michael, you did all this?"
15688,Michael,Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
15689,Michael,"Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day."
15690,Michael,Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
15691,Pam,"So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?"
15692,Pam,49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.
15693,Jim,"Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. "
15694,Michael,You're 54 years old.
15695,Michael,You're 58 years old?
15696,Michael,The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.
15697,Pam,"Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?"
15698,Pam,I want you to be Grandma.
15699,Michael,"Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?"
15700,Michael,"I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?"
15701,Michael,"So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done."
15702,Michael,Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
15703,Michael,You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
15704,Michael, Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
15705,Michael,Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.
15706,Dwight,What's going on in here?
15707,Andy,"Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness."
15708,Dwight,There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
15709,Andy,"You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone."
15710,Dwight,"Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!"
15711,Michael,So we should get the check?
15712,Pam,What about your gift Michael?
15713,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it."
15714,Pam,He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
15715,Michael,I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
15716,Michael,That's just an arbitrary title.
15717,Jim,Penny for your thoughts.
15718,Michael,"It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows."
15719,Michael,Oh that I plagiarized I think.
15720,Pam,That's really nice Michael.
15721,Michael,"Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us."
15722,Jim,You set the bar so high.
15723,Michael,That was a bunt.
15724,Andy,"Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this."
15725,Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered."
15726,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist. "
15727,Andy,"Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous."
15728,Dwight,Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.
15729,Pam,Hey. Where'd you go?
15730,Michael,"Oh, just went to the bathroom."
15731,Pam,And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
15732,Pam,"Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake."
15733,Michael,"Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself."
15734,Michael,"Finish your cake, Helene."
15735,Michael,"I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing."
15736,Michael,"Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her."
15737,Pam,"Michael. Michael ,it's okay."
15738,Pam,"I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy."
15739,Michael,Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
15740,Michael," Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping."
15741,Michael,"And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there."
15742,Michael,It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer--  -- tility.
15743,Andy,Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.
15744,Andy,What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.
15745,Dwight,"Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time."
15746,Andy,It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
15747,Dwight,Got it.  To Dwight. Wha--  Starbucks gift card.
15748,Andy,Surprise!  It's from everybody. $15 value.
15749,Dwight,Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now.  They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.
15750,Michael,May I have a word with you in my office please?
15751,Michael,"Well, this is a work related matter."
15752,Michael,"Yes. Join me please, won't you?  I am going to give you a raise."
15753,Michael,Because of all the good work you've done.
15754,Pam,I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
15755,Michael,"That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude."
15756,Pam,I have the worst attitude of any person here.
15757,Michael,Do you want the raise or what?
15758,Pam,"Yeah, I'll take it. "
15759,Michael,"Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude."
15760,Michael,No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
15761,Pam,I want to hit you.
15762,Pam,I want to hit you. I'll do that.
15763,Michael," Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?"
15764,Pam,No. Are you kidding?
15765,Michael,Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
15766,Pam,No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.
15767,Pam,"So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can."
15768,Michael,Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
15769,Ryan,We heard about the punch.
15770,Michael,I'm pretty sure we said slap.
15771,Ryan,I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you?
15772,Michael,I-- mmm-- I'm good.
15773,Ryan,alright. See you there.
15774,Michael,Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
15775,Michael,I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
15776,Jim,She wants it bad Michael.
15777,Michael,Can you stop this?
15778,Jim,And I don't support her choice to hit you.
15779,Jim,But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
15780,Jim,I just need some time.
15781,Michael,You gotta do something--
15782,Jim,I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
15783,Michael,How much time do you think you'll need?
15784,Jim,No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.
15785,Pam, Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
15786,Kevin,My money's on Pam.
15787,Oscar,It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be?
15788,Oscar,How? He can't hit back.
15789,Kevin,Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
15790,Michael,Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  Let's do this.
15791,Michael,It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
15792,Kevin,"We're here for the show, Michael."
15793,Michael,You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
15794,Pam," You have to keep your hands down, Michael."
15795,Michael,I know.  Okay. Alright.  Oh-- God!
15796,Pam,"Michael, you have to put your hands down."
15797,Angela,Put your hands in your pockets.
15798,Michael,"Okay!  Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry."
15799,Pam,What are you sorry for?
15800,Michael,So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
15801,Pam,How about for dating my mom?
15802,Pam,And dumping her on her birthday.
15803,Pam,Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
15804,Michael,Okay. I promise.  For the record your mom came on to me. 
15805,Pam,No. You were right.
15806,Dwight," Wait, why are you limping?"
15807,Dwight,Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
15808,Michael,"As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me."
15809,Dwight,"Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down."
15810,Michael,Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
15811,Dwight,I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.
15812,Michael,What are you talking about--
15813,Dwight,Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.
15814,Dwight,Can I have an office?
15815,Dwight,You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.
15816,Michael, Oh that feels better.
15817,Dwight," Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!"
15818,Jim,"Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change."
15819,Dwight,How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch 
15820,Jim,"OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know."
15821,Dwight,"No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!"
15822,Kevin,No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
15823,Dwight,False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!
15824,Jim,"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you."
15825,Dwight,That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.
15826,Jim,"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?"
15827,Dwight,Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes.  Block. Grasp wrist as such. 
15828,Jim,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two."
15829,Dwight,"Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow.  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!"
15830,Jim,"Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool."
15831,Dwight,"He really is, but not for long.  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on."
15832,Jim,You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
15833,Dwight,The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. 
15834,Michael,But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
15835,Andy,I did stand up comedy once.
15836,Michael,That sounds like it was hilarious.
15837,Dwight,What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
15838,Michael,"You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day."
15839,Dwight,"This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin."
15840,Michael,"Woo hoo, shout out!"
15841,Dwight,Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
15842,Michael,"Erin, do we have the journal?"
15843,Erin,Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.
15844,Pam,"Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online."
15845,Oscar,"I found the article.  ""On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend... "" and the article cuts off."
15846,Michael,It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say? 
15847,Andy,"I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it."
15848,Michael,"No, no, that doesn't make any sense."
15849,Oscar,"Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt."
15850,Michael,"Oh, that sounds awful."
15851,Oscar,Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
15852,Michael,"Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory."
15853,Dwight,You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
15854,Michael,"Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! "
15855,Michael,"OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye.  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free."
15856,Kevin," Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there?"
15857,Michael,"No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be."
15858,Kevin,It smells like throw up in here.
15859,Michael,Crazy world. Lotta smells.
15860,Andy,"I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws."
15861,Jim, We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
15862,Michael,"OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins."
15863,Jim,"Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along."
15864,Michael,"Monkey see, monkey do."
15865,Michael,Monkey pee all over you.
15866,Jim,"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?"
15867,Michael,We have a monthly staff meeting
15868,Jim,"Alright, let's conference room it up!  Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working."
15869,Jim,"Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good."
15870,Jim,"Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that."
15871,Dwight, He needs me. Seat saved infinity. 
15872,Michael, What? Oh my God!  There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah. 
15873,Michael,"Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across."
15874,Michael,"It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it..."
15875,Jim,"Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea."
15876,Michael,"This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder."
15877,Jim,I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
15878,Michael,"Tube City, you owe me one."
15879,Jim,"Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one."
15880,Michael,"There will be food. You leave, you do not get food."
15881,Michael,"OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse."
15882,Kevin,"Whoa, I'll try it."
15883,Michael,"OK, use your imaginations."
15884,Erin,"Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal."
15885,Andy,"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother."
15886,Angela,"Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary."
15887,Angela,I don't like my character.
15888,Angela,"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this. "
15889,Michael,"Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful."
15890,Michael," Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare?"
15891,Oscar,"It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company."
15892,Michael,"Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare."
15893,Ryan,"You don't have to keep saying ""I do declare"". Any time you say something it means you are declaring."
15894,Michael,That is the way Southern people talk.
15895,Jim,And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
15896,Michael,"Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?"
15897,Pam,I'll go.  My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short.
15898,Pam,Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
15899,Andy,"Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth."
15900,Kevin,"Oooo, now do the Swedish chef."
15901,Andy,"Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?"
15902,Kevin,"He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass."
15903,Dwight,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!"
15904,Michael,"No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing."
15905,Dwight,I will poison your food.
15906,Andy,"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind."
15907,Michael,"Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!"
15908,Michael,I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
15909,Michael," Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect."
15910,Michael,"Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. "
15911,Andy, Hey there young lady.
15912,Andy,I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
15913,Erin,"Sounds like a plan, Sugar."
15914,Andy,"Alright, a plan it is."
15915,Dwight,"Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts."
15916,Angela,"It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter."
15917,Dwight,I know you did it!
15918,Dwight,"I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect."
15919,Kevin, Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.
15920,Erin,"Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay."
15921,Erin,"Yeah, my boudoir's always open."
15922,Andy,"I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer."
15923,Oscar,"I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors."
15924,Oscar,"Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-"
15925,Michael," Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah."
15926,Oscar," This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay...  - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern."
15927,Jim,"OK, I'm going back to work."
15928,Michael,No no no no no no no.  I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go.
15929,Michael," Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is.  Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?"
15930,Jim,"OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting."
15931,Kevin,That could be a good sign.
15932,Angela,"Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up."
15933,Jim,"Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work."
15934,Kevin,"Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign."
15935,Angela,Don't just say things.
15936,Jim," Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-"
15937,Michael," I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case."
15938,Jim,"No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed."
15939,Dwight,"Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns."
15940,Andy,"Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time."
15941,Erin,I haven't seen it.
15942,Andy,"Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?"
15943,Erin, Where are you taking me?
15944,Andy," Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah."
15945,Erin, Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton.
15946,Andy,Did you mean a real date?
15947,Erin,"I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game."
15948,Dwight,"You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?"
15949,Michael,"I already declared you, it was too dark to tell."
15950,Dwight,"Stop playing games with me, Crawdad."
15951,Michael,"This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir."
15952,Michael,You are out of order.
15953,Dwight,You are out of order.
15954,Pam,I think Michael may have snapped.
15955,Jim,Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
15956,Pam,"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?"
15957,Jim,Both. They're both worse.
15958,Jim,"It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under."
15959,Pam,"Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one."
15960,Michael," Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?"
15961,Michael,"Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on."
15962,Pam,I should just go.  Where to now Caleb?
15963,Michael,To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
15964,Jim,"Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why."
15965,Michael,Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
15966,Dwight,Hey shut up. You're dead.
15967,Jim,"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?"
15968,Michael,"No Michael here, my name is-"
15969,Jim,Today of all days...
15970,Michael,"No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright? "
15971,Michael," Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for?"
15972,Erin,Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.
15973,Erin,I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
15974,Michael,"Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here."
15975,Oscar,You're not gonna answer the phone?
15976,Michael,"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room."
15977,Jim,"Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-"
15978,Jim,Well there is some bad news.  There has been another murder.
15979,Michael,"A murder, you say? I do declare."
15980,Dwight,"Oh, this could be a juicy one."
15981,Jim,"I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now."
15982,Michael,"There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more.  Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time."
15983,Andy, I didn't do it!
15984,Dwight,"OK, everybody just calm down."
15985,Michael,On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
15986,Michael,"We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?"
15987,Jim,"Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6:00."
15988,Pam, It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!
15989,Jim,"Yeah, I want to go home."
15990,Pam,"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. "
15991,Dwight,Bow down before Recyclops.
15992,Jim,"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops."
15993,Dwight,"Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?"
15994,Jim,The next year he really stepped things up.
15995,Dwight,Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
15996,Jim,A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
15997,Dwight,Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
15998,Jim,Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
15999,Dwight,Recyclops will have his revenge.
16000,Jim,I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
16001,Pam,"Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops."
16002,Andy,That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
16003,Dwight,Humans are terrible for the environment.
16004,Pam,The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
16005,Pam,A world where you truly can be anything you want.
16006,Jim,"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. "
16007,Michael, Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? 
16008,Michael,"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. "
16009,Michael,Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
16010,Michael,"Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild."
16011,Andy," Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. "
16012,Pam,Don't do the twirl.
16013,Kevin,"Michael, I hated the twirl."
16014,Michael,Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
16015,Michael,"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin."
16016,Oscar,The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
16017,Michael,"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points."
16018,Oscar,Those are the bullet points.
16019,Michael,"Well, could you condense it please?"
16020,Oscar,That's as simple as I can make it.
16021,Erin,Michael? The limo's here for you.
16022,Michael,"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling."
16023,Erin,"He said limousine, so..."
16024,Kevin," Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here.  Michael, look. Oh, man."
16025,Michael,They sent a limo.
16026,Michael,Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
16027,Michael," Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that."
16028,Dwight,What kind of mileage does this baby get?
16029,Erin,It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
16030,Oscar,This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
16031,Michael,Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
16032,Dwight,Calves. Calves all the way.
16033,Andy,I'm so jealous right now.
16034,Michael,"Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-"
16035,Michael,The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
16036,Ryan,I'll use it when you're done.
16037,Oscar,"The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers."
16038,Michael, I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.
16039,Andy,"Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had s*x in here?"
16040,Michael,Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
16041,Michael, Who's playing with the button?
16042,Jim,"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?"
16043,Ryan,"Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under."
16044,Jim,But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
16045,Ryan,"The company's probably going under, though."
16046,Jim,Could go either way.
16047,Ryan,Seems like it's leaning one way.
16048,Jim,Maybe we should just wait and find out.
16049,Ryan,So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
16050,Jim,Nah. Might as well do it now.
16051,Andy,"Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?"
16052,Michael,I will have to answer.
16053,Dwight,I'll ask you a question.
16054,Andy,"Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park."
16055,Dwight,Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
16056,Michael,"No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.'  I won't say that. I'll something like that."
16057,Andy,This is your big day. Come on.
16058,Michael,"Oh, my god. This is it."
16059,Michael,"Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott."
16060,Michael,"Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -"
16061,Michael,"Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime."
16062,Michael,"It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege."
16063,Dwight,"Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che.  Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.  Ah. Damn it.  Wha- okay "
16064,Dwight,"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy."
16065,Oscar,"Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall.  Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple."
16066,Andy,"Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line."
16067,Oscar,"Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you."
16068,Andy,"Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?"
16069,Dwight,How is he gonna have grandkids?
16070,Michael,You guys ever protect the president?
16071,Michael,What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
16072,Michael, This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
16073,Michael," We're going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry."
16074,Dwight,No. You will not.
16075,Dwight,"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?"
16076,Dwight,Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
16077,Jim,"Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?"
16078,Jim,Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
16079,Jim,I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael.  What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
16080,Jim,"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?"
16081,Jim,Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? 
16082,Pam,Stuff gets around. I don't participate.
16083,Jim,Who here heard it from Ryan?
16084,Kevin,Does and email count?
16085,Jim,I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? 
16086,Pam,I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
16087,Oscar,These questions are bush league.
16088,Andy,You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there.  Don't be a wuss.
16089,Andy,"I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose ."
16090,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -"
16091,Ryan,Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
16092,Jim,I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
16093,Pam,Can you actually fire people?
16094,Jim,"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people."
16095,Pam,"Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone."
16096,Jim,"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell."
16097,Pam,"Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'."
16098,Jim,"Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day."
16099,Pam,"Well, you'll figure it out."
16100,Michael," Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers.  I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -"
16101,Michael,"Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You."
16102,Jim,"Hey, Ryan. How's it going?"
16103,Ryan," Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist..."
16104,Ryan,That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
16105,Jim,"Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it."
16106,Ryan,Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
16107,Jim,I think I know the problem.
16108,Jim,I think you seem distracted.
16109,Ryan,"Yep, that is a problem."
16110,Jim,"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help."
16111,Ryan,"Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim."
16112,Jim,"I am, too. Let me show you."
16113,Michael,Wow. Things are really picking up.
16114,Michael,I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
16115,Michael,"We tell them the plan, right?"
16116,Michael,"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes."
16117,Michael,Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
16118,Michael,I am the guy who roused that crowd.
16119,Michael,Got them on their feet.
16120,Michael,They were so happy down there.
16121,Michael,"Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor."
16122,Michael,"Well, I'm texting him, so."
16123,Michael,"Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. "
16124,Jim,"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.  Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention.  I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people."
16125,Jim,"Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done."
16126,Ryan,"I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight."
16127,Ryan,"Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything."
16128,Jim, You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. 
16129,Michael,Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
16130,Michael,Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
16131,Michael,It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
16132,Oscar,"I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands."
16133,Michael,That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
16134,Oscar,I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
16135,Michael,"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing?"
16136,Oscar,"Michael, I didn't ask to come up here."
16137,Michael,"Wow, man. That -"
16138,Michael,"For me, too. You embarrassed me."
16139,Michael,"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow."
16140,Michael,"Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron."
16141,Michael,"Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate."
16142,Michael, Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
16143,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.  Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there.  A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to."
16144,Andy,You wanted to see me?
16145,Michael,"Yeah, Have a seat."
16146,Andy,Is it serious?  Wow. Andy's a wittle scared.
16147,Michael,"Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk."
16148,Andy,Why would people say that?
16149,Michael,I have it on good authority that you said the following.  Can you read that back to me?
16150,Andy,Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
16151,Andy,"Would you rather me say ""Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?"""
16152,Andy,"""Crazy diarrhea happening right now?"" Cause things can get real adult real fast."
16153,Michael,"You are also on record as saying ""wittle-ittle,"" ""footy-wutties,"" ""nummies,"" ""jammies,"" ""make boom-boom,"" ""widiculous,"" and ""wode iwand."""
16154,Andy,"Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy."
16155,Michael,You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies.
16156,Andy,"Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying."
16157,Michael,"Okay, who said that?"
16158,Andy,"I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic."
16159,Michael," Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops."
16160,Andy, Tank you Mr. Elwis.
16161,Andy,"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news."
16162,Jim,"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?"
16163,Andy,The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
16164,Jim,"Wow, what do you put our chances at?"
16165,Andy,"0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!"
16166,Andy,Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
16167,Andy,"Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron."
16168,Jim,"Wow, that's not such a bad idea."
16169,Erin,Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those.
16170,Erin,"There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say ""Delivered."" Should I delete all of those?"
16171,Michael,I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
16172,Erin,"That's why you have a ""Sent Mail"" folder."
16173,Erin,"There's about 30 news alerts for ""Nip Slip."""
16174,Michael,Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there...
16175,Michael,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?"
16176,Jim,Did you murder someone?
16177,Michael,Lurk much?  I miss Pam.
16178,Jim,I think she's okay.
16179,Michael,"Is that what we're going for now? ""okay?"" We used to go for ""pretty good."""
16180,Jim,"Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?"
16181,Michael,"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but..."
16182,Jim,"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager."
16183,Michael,"Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month."
16184,Jim,It would look bad. Sorry.
16185,Michael,"It would look good, on my mantle."
16186,Andy,Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!
16187,Dwight,"My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired."
16188,Erin,"Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?"
16189,Erin,"Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't."
16190,Pam,Okay.  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
16191,Michael,There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
16192,Pam,"Michael, why did you promise that?"
16193,Pam,"No Michael, why would you promise that?"
16194,Michael,"Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this."
16195,Erin,We've already rescheduled seven times.
16196,Pam,"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done."
16197,Pam,"Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get."
16198,Michael,"I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous."
16199,Michael,"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?"
16200,Michael,"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right."
16201,Pam,You have to tell them.
16202,Michael,"Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of... "
16203,Erin,I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
16204,Pam,"It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth."
16205,Michael,"Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?"
16206,Dwight,"Hey Jimmy, what's up?"
16207,Dwight,"Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office."
16208,Dwight,That laugh is so infectious.
16209,Jim,You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.
16210,Dwight,I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.
16211,Jim,"Let me guess, you think you should get it."
16212,Dwight,"This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize."
16213,Jim,"Well, in an ideal world..."
16214,Dwight,"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching."
16215,Jim,"Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away ""Survival Skills"" and ""Self-defense."""
16216,Dwight,I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
16217,Jim,"That's okay, I'll do it."
16218,Michael,"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?"
16219,Michael,Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone?
16220,Michael,"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind."
16221,Michael,"Well, you didn't even hear it."
16222,Michael,"No, not at all. Nope, come on."
16223,Michael,"Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just..."
16224,Dwight,"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-"
16225,Dwight,So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
16226,Dwight,He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
16227,Kevin,"No, no, that makes total sense."
16228,Dwight,"Hey buddy, so every-"
16229,Dwight,Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule.
16230,Michael," Oh, God. Oh, God."
16231,Jim,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is?"
16232,Andy,"Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert."
16233,Oscar,Are you kidding me?
16234,Jim,"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-"
16235,Kevin,I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
16236,Jim,"Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score."
16237,Angela,"To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us."
16238,Jim,"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize."
16239,Dwight,"Yeah, you said ""In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize."" Isn't that what you said?"
16240,Jim,"No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But-"
16241,Michael,"All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between ""A"" gym and ""B"" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm.  Should we go?"
16242,Michael,"Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?"
16243,Michael,"Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry."
16244,Michael,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
16245,Michael,"I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place."
16246,Michael,"Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you."
16247,Michael,"Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium."
16248,Jim,"Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway."
16249,Andy,Correction. It was my idea.
16250,Pam,"Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on."
16251,Andy,"That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert."
16252,Dwight,There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
16253,Pam,"No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month."
16254,Andy,"Oh, really? From what, two to four?"
16255,Jim,"Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?"
16256,Jim,"Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake."
16257,Kevin,Look who it is! 
16258,Angela,"""It could only be you!"" Way to go."
16259,Dwight,He knew all along!
16260,Dwight," This is Kevin Malone, is David there?"
16261,Dwight,"Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam."
16262,Dwight, This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.
16263,Dwight," It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here."
16264,Michael,"Erin, can you give us a second?"
16265,Michael,"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry."
16266,Michael,What can I do?
16267,Michael,"I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?"
16268,Michael,"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?"
16269,Michael,Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year.
16270,Michael,"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around."
16271,Michael,That's a lot of zeroes.
16272,Jim,"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it."
16273,Jim,"I really don't know how it happened, David."
16274,Dwight,I know how it happened.
16275,Jim,"All right, it will not happen again. I promise."
16276,Dwight,"Oh, you're kidding me!"
16277,Erin,"Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---"
16278,Michael,Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today.
16279,Erin,"No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy."
16280,Michael,"You're what, like, 12?"
16281,Erin,"The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think."
16282,Michael,I think you're doing a great job.
16283,Michael,"What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?"
16284,Erin,I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
16285,Erin,"Yes, but I'm terrible at math so..."
16286,Michael,"You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse."
16287,Michael,Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too.
16288,Jim,"See you tomorrow, Dwight."
16289,Ryan,How's it going? Good day?
16290,Ryan,"Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan."
16291,Dwight,What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... 
16292,Ryan,I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
16293,Dwight,So what do you want?
16294,Ryan,I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in.
16295,Dwight," Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--"
16296,Jim,"Too, too loud. Too Loud."
16297,Dwight,"But effective, look!  On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas."
16298,Dwight,My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph!  Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
16299,Dwight,It is time to unveil the tree.
16300,Ryan,"Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that."
16301,Jim,This is all we have.
16302,Jim,"No, it's not ""ugh."" It is... office camaraderie."
16303,Dwight,It is warm feelings.
16304,Jim,Why would you start so high?
16305,Dwight,Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
16306,Jim,"We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together."
16307,Andy,"Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?"
16308,Pam,"Is it, is it fake?"
16309,Dwight,"Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die..."
16310,Dwight,Like the spirit of Christmas!
16311,Dwight,This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
16312,Erin,Hello. Sorry guys.  Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove
16313,Andy,I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? 
16314,Oscar,They finally let you do it!
16315,Pam,"So Santa, what can we expect from this party?"
16316,Jim,"Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!"
16317,Dwight,"For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!"
16318,Pam,"You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!"
16319,Pam,"Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny.  I think my water just broke!"
16320,Pam,Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
16321,Michael,"Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. "
16322,Pam,"Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis."
16323,Michael,What the hell is going on?
16324,Michael,"Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?"
16325,Jim,Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
16326,Michael,Take it back. That is absurd.
16327,Jim,"No, I'm not gonna do that."
16328,Michael,No? No! Jim! Come on!
16329,Jim,I think she's doing a good job.
16330,Michael,"It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!"
16331,Jim,I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
16332,Michael,"Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those."
16333,Michael,"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably ""freedom."" At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore."
16334,Michael," Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!"
16335,Michael,"No it's not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what's your name?"
16336,Kevin,"Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap."
16337,Michael,"Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well."
16338,Kevin,When can I sit on your lap?
16339,Michael,"Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God."
16340,Michael,What would you like for Christmas little boy?
16341,Kevin,I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
16342,Michael,What did you think was going to happen?
16343,Kevin,I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
16344,Michael,"All right, just say ""some toys"" please."
16345,Kevin,Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
16346,Michael,"Damn it Kevin, come on."
16347,Kevin,What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
16348,Michael,"Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!"
16349,Kevin,I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
16350,Michael,Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
16351,Jim,I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
16352,Jim,That's what I want.
16353,Jim,What would Bob do?
16354,Erin,It stings a lot.
16355,Erin,I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
16356,Erin,So far no one will admit to it.
16357,Andy,Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.
16358,Andy,"""Seriously?"" Are you serious?"
16359,Andy,Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
16360,Oscar,Is Matt around? I got his check.
16361,Oscar,"Ah, I'll just... wait for him."
16362,Oscar,I'll just leave it here with you. 
16363,Michael,"Come on, come on."
16364,Ryan,I'm doing something over here.
16365,Michael,Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here!
16366,Ryan,What are you talking about?
16367,Jim,Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
16368,Michael,Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
16369,Jim,Can I just talk to you for a second?
16370,Jim,"You can't yell out ""I need this, I need this"" as you pin down an employee on your lap!"
16371,Michael,"Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!"
16372,Michael,"Do you understand, you forced my hand?"
16373,Jim,"Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa."
16374,Michael,"Oh, do we? Do ""We?"" Is that what ""we"" want? Why don't ""we"" take a vote on it?"
16375,Michael,Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
16376,Jim,Who wants Phyllis as Santa? 
16377,Michael,"No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?"
16378,Kevin,Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
16379,Jim,"And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.  Can I get you some punch?"
16380,Michael,I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. 
16381,Dwight,"Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger."
16382,Dwight,What else does it look like?
16383,Dwight,Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
16384,Michael,"I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. ""Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself."" That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me."
16385,Michael,"Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget."
16386,Michael,Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
16387,Michael,"Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!"
16388,Andy,"Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?"
16389,Pam,Have you talked to him?
16390,Oscar,Is it that obvious?  No- hey...
16391,Pam,"Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?"
16392,Pam,"Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate."
16393,Pam,"Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?"
16394,Pam,Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
16395,Dwight,We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. 
16396,Michael," Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?"
16397,Michael,Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
16398,Michael," Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?"
16399,Kevin,He got scented candles!
16400,Michael," Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley."
16401,Michael," I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up."
16402,Angela,It's fabric! I really wanted this.
16403,Michael, That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
16404,Angela,"Andy, is this you?"
16405,Michael, What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on.
16406,Michael,"David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as."
16407,Michael,I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
16408,Michael,"I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa."
16409,Michael,Really? What's going on?
16410,Michael,What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
16411,Erin,Do you want me off the call too Michael?
16412,Michael,Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
16413,Michael,What does that mean?
16414,Michael,"Well, can't Alan protect you?"
16415,Michael,"Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into."
16416,Michael,Hey. How's everybody doing?
16417,Jim,Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
16418,Michael,That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
16419,Angela,Are you serious? This is so offensive.
16420,Michael,"You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room."
16421,Dwight,What's your pin number?
16422,Michael,"I don't want to say. But, ""it's fun to stay at the -"" "
16423,Michael,"""It's fun to stay at the -"""
16424,Dwight,Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
16425,Michael," Mmm, mm mm mm. "
16426,Andy,"I, I thought that you would like it."
16427,Erin,It was a little much Andy.
16428,Andy,Well it's the thought that counts.
16429,Erin,What were you thinking? 
16430,Andy,"I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen."
16431,Michael,"You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, ""How could they do this to us?"""
16432,Pam,How could we do what? 
16433,Michael,It's not... Nevermind. Nothing. 
16434,Michael,I didn't say anything!
16435,Angela,If you know something Michael...
16436,Michael,We're going out of business!
16437,Dwight,You are kidding me!
16438,Jim,"Wait wait wait, who said that?"
16439,Michael,David told me on the phone. David told me.
16440,Dwight,When? When did he tell you? Today?
16441,Michael,"He said, we have been sold. "
16442,Jim,"Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?"
16443,Michael,David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
16444,Jim,Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
16445,Michael,"It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith."
16446,Michael,I'll call him. I'll call David.
16447,Jim,"No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone."
16448,Michael,"Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him."
16449,Michael,"He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom."
16450,Michael,"It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott."
16451,Michael,Stephanie could you hop off please?
16452,Michael,"David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse."
16453,Michael,"David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned."
16454,Michael,Well I think we're past that now.
16455,Jim,"Oh my God, David. That's horrible."
16456,Michael,Yeah!  It's a Christmas miracle!
16457,Dwight," I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. "
16458,Dwight,It's true. We all walk alone.
16459,Dwight, My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
16460,Ryan,Yeah! That was the idea.
16461,Kevin," Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging..."
16462,Michael,Oh! You got it? What is that? 
16463,Dwight,I have no idea.
16464,Michael,"Huh. Well, maybe those will help. "
16465,Dwight,Michael? Please! Come on!
16466,Oscar,Nice to meet you Mark!
16467,Oscar,"Right, Matt.  I know what I'm doing, Pam."
16468,Dwight,"Oh man!  I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails..."
16469,Michael,I'd like to make a wish.
16470,Michael,"I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry."
16471,Michael,Oh God. Get a room Santas!
16472,Michael,Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
16473,Dwight,It's real slippery out here. 
16474,Andy,Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! 
16475,Michael,"Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens."
16476,Michael," I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?"
16477,Michael,What is the world's largest ocean?
16478,Michael,"Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?"
16479,Andy,"Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL."
16480,Michael,"That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant."
16481,Pam,Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
16482,Pam,"It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are."
16483,Pam,"For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it."
16484,Michael,"Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -"
16485,Michael,"- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?"
16486,Michael,They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
16487,Michael,"No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it."
16488,Michael,Alright. Excuse me.  If you will -
16489,Ryan,"Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -"
16490,Michael,"- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. "
16491,Dwight,"Oh, we will. Have a seat. "
16492,Michael,"I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time."
16493,Dwight,"He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?"
16494,Dwight,Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
16495,Dwight,"Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host.  Welcome. "
16496,Michael,"Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?"
16497,Michael,Stuff. I love stuff.
16498,Michael,HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
16499,Michael,"Talkin' bout, uh, what?"
16500,Michael,Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
16501,Michael,"Oh, time and resources."
16502,Michael,"No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. "
16503,Michael,This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.  Right? Would you agree with that?
16504,Michael,"That's, that is true. "
16505,Dwight," Thank you, so much."
16506,Pam,Good to meet you.
16507,Angela,Have a great day.
16508,Dwight,Hope to see you soon.
16509,Michael,I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? 
16510,Michael,I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
16511,Michael,"Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?"
16512,Michael,Just - sh -
16513,Michael,Shut up. Shut up.
16514,Michael," Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'."
16515,Dwight,"Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty."
16516,Michael,So check out how we live
16517,Michael,They call it Scranton!
16518,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
16519,Michael,"The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider."
16520,Dwight,But check that it's covered by your
16521,Michael,Plenty of space in the parking lot.
16522,Dwight,But the little cars go in the compact spot!
16523,Dwight,Don't lose your head.
16524,Michael,They call it Scranton!
16525,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
16526,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
16527,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
16528,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton!
16529,Michael,"Oh, yeah.  I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? "
16530,Erin," I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? "
16531,Oscar,I think you don't know what you're saying.
16532,Michael,"It's from ""Sob-ray"", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me. "
16533,Michael,"Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre.  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses."
16534,Michael,"Oh!  Wow. Awesome.  For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you."
16535,Dwight,Here we go.  Oh! Wow.
16536,Erin,"Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?"
16537,Michael,"Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -"
16538,Dwight,Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
16539,Michael,"Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened..."
16540,Michael,And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
16541,Pam,"Well, maybe we can put the box back together."
16542,Dwight,Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
16543,Oscar,I think we can do it.
16544,Oscar,Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
16545,Oscar,"Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?"
16546,Michael,"And -  Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. "
16547,Michael,"Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. "
16548,Michael, Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
16549,Michael,"Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?"
16550,Pam,What do you want us to do?
16551,Michael,Why do I have to explain everything?
16552,Pam,Because we're usually not on the same page.
16553,Michael,Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is.  You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
16554,Dwight,Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
16555,Michael,"You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?"
16556,Michael,"Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert."
16557,Jim,Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
16558,Michael,"We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?"
16559,Michael,We have a little song prepared for you.
16560,Michael,"Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys."
16561,Andy,"Saber.  Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay."
16562,Andy,You sure it's saber?
16563,Jim,"Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20."
16564,Pam,"Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away."
16565,Jim,"Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute."
16566,Pam,We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
16567,Jim,"Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird."
16568,Pam,We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
16569,Jim,"But if not, there's always the army. The infantry."
16570,Jim," So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, ""What's going on?"" Well, you're not alone."
16571,Michael,No. Don't like that.
16572,Oscar,But I banked six weeks.
16573,Angela,I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
16574,Michael,"Mm, nope. Don't like that."
16575,Michael,"We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?"
16576,Michael,I don't know what they're made of.
16577,Dwight,They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
16578,Michael,"You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley."
16579,Michael,"There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -"
16580,Michael, Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
16581,Michael,I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
16582,Michael,I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
16583,Michael,"Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em."
16584,Michael,So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
16585,Jim," Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies."
16586,Pam,There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
16587,Jim,"Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom."
16588,Jim,I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
16589,Jim,I don't know. I don't know.
16590,Pam,The guy we're meeting with?
16591,Jim,"I don't know, I don't know."
16592,Andy,"I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here."
16593,Erin,"Well, I saw them in there."
16594,Andy,"Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like,  ""Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries."""
16595,Erin,I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
16596,Andy,The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
16597,Michael,Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
16598,Michael,Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
16599,Michael,"Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -"
16600,Michael,Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
16601,Michael,"I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help."
16602,Jim,"This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -"
16603,Jim,"No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular."
16604,Pam,"Ok, you've got to pull it together."
16605,Jim,We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
16606,Pam,He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
16607,Jim,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
16608,Pam,That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
16609,Michael,"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry."
16610,Michael,I hope you're not busy doing something.
16611,Michael,You look great too.
16612,Michael,"Oh, yeah, that sounds good."
16613,Michael,"Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend."
16614,Michael,Can I just stay here and never go back?
16615,Michael,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?"
16616,Michael,"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see..."
16617,Jim,"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit."
16618,Jim,"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes."
16619,Pam,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
16620,Jim,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
16621,Pam,"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well."
16622,Pam,Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
16623,Jim,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?"
16624,Jim,Anybody could have walked in.
16625,Michael,"Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?"
16626,Michael,Exactly. What are you thinking?
16627,Michael,It is a tough one.
16628,Michael,Yeah. But one would be good.
16629,Michael,So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
16630,Michael,"No, I think it is-"
16631,Andy,"Hey, any fun weekend plans?"
16632,Andy,"Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?"
16633,Erin,Nothing. It's wide open.
16634,Andy,That's as hard as I can hint.
16635,Michael,There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
16636,Michael,Thanks for having me.
16637,Michael,"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here."
16638,Michael,"Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go."
16639,Michael,You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
16640,Michael,"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches."
16641,Michael,But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
16642,Michael,No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
16643,Michael,"Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good."
16644,Kevin,Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
16645,Michael,Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
16646,Michael,"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome."
16647,Michael,"Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics."
16648,Dwight," I'm not seeing anything under ""confirmation."""
16649,Dwight,"Could it be under ""affirmation?"" Cause you have thousands of those."
16650,Michael,No.  We're trying to look it up right now.
16651,Michael,"Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation."
16652,Dwight,"Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!"
16653,Michael,"Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please."
16654,Michael,"Okay, put it on my card."
16655,Michael,"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?"
16656,Michael,"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett."
16657,Andy, These sure are pretty dogs...
16658,Dwight,"I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy."
16659,Andy,Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
16660,Andy,"Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem ""too eager,"" so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit."
16661,Michael,"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job."
16662,Jim,"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the ""big-picture"" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together..."
16663,Michael,And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
16664,Jim,I don't think so.
16665,Michael,I humbly accept the management position.
16666,Jim,I... Why would you just say something like that?
16667,Michael,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now."
16668,Jim,Do you even know what that means?
16669,Erin,"Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!"
16670,Erin,Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
16671,Andy,"There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card."
16672,Erin," Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!"
16673,Andy,"Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock."
16674,Andy,"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?"
16675,Erin,"Uh, yeah I do remember.  Aw, they love each other."
16676,Andy,"Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed."
16677,Erin,"Wow, it smells really good too."
16678,Andy,"Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there."
16679,Erin,"Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!"
16680,Andy,It's got pheromones in it.
16681,Kevin,"Jo, there's books in my chair."
16682,Michael,"No, we know. Texas!"
16683,Michael,I could manage my way around that.
16684,Michael,I will try to manage my excitement!
16685,Michael,"I have been saying the word ""manager"" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks ""manager"" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a pen1s. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a pen1s. And vise-versa."
16686,Pam,"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year."
16687,Jim,This is way more than I make now.
16688,Jim,"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women."
16689,Jim,"Hey, you got a second?"
16690,Michael,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
16691,Jim,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
16692,Michael,"La la la, hello Oscar!"
16693,Michael,What are you reading?
16694,Michael,"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again."
16695,Oscar,I should step into sales myself.
16696,Michael,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?"
16697,Oscar,Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
16698,Michael,...Where did you get that information.
16699,Michael,"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled."
16700,Michael,Son of a bitch.  Pardon me.
16701,Michael,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales."
16702,Michael,"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman."
16703,Jim,"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons."
16704,Michael,"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people."
16705,Jim,Why would you do that?
16706,Michael,I'm turning myself in right now!
16707,Michael,"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss."
16708,Pam," Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!"
16709,Dwight," Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds.  89... 88..."
16710,Dwight,You're twenty minutes late!
16711,Ryan," Um, I was at another dumpster!"
16712,Dwight,Just admit you lost track of time.
16713,Dwight,Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
16714,Ryan,Did you see Saw?
16715,Dwight,Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
16716,Ryan,"No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?"
16717,Dwight,"Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw."
16718,Ryan,"Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment."
16719,Dwight,I like where you're going with this. Continue.
16720,Ryan,Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
16721,Dwight,I have an old barn!
16722,Dwight,"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?"
16723,Ryan,"We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask..."
16724,Dwight,"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!"
16725,Ryan,Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
16726,Dwight,He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
16727,Ryan,Don't just criticize my idea!
16728,Ryan,You think of something then!
16729,Erin,"Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk."
16730,Michael,How is that possible?
16731,Erin,"Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space."
16732,Michael,"No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen."
16733,Erin,"You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager."
16734,Michael,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales."
16735,Jim," You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there."
16736,Dwight,The new IT guy. Nick.
16737,Dwight,"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it."
16738,Dwight,"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?"
16739,Ryan,"Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum."
16740,Dwight,Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
16741,Dwight,I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
16742,Erin,"It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say ""Who's hungry?"""
16743,Jim,"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though."
16744,Erin,Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
16745,Jim,Why would I wanna do that?
16746,Erin,"It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain."
16747,Jim,"For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here..."
16748,Michael," It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye.  I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called ""Curves."" I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!"
16749,Dwight,"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much."
16750,Michael,Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
16751,Dwight,It's not really 1992 anymore.
16752,Erin,"Well, everyone got one."
16753,Erin,Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
16754,Erin,"It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all."
16755,Dwight,"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room."
16756,Dwight,"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords."
16757,Dwight,"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him."
16758,Dwight,"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer."
16759,Ryan,"Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you."
16760,Michael,What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
16761,Michael,"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?"
16762,Michael,"You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps."
16763,Michael,"No, this is geological."
16764,Michael,Are you kidding me?
16765,Michael,And you guys are okay with this?
16766,Dwight,"She sent an email, so."
16767,Andy, It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
16768,Andy,"I'm sorry, I thought you saw me."
16769,Andy,I don't even know what that card said.
16770,Michael,"You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here."
16771,Jim,"Well, the grass is always greener."
16772,Michael,Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
16773,Jim,"Well, it's what you wanted."
16774,Michael,I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
16775,Jim,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do."
16776,Michael,"We make a poster that says ""Happy Opposite Day!"" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black."
16777,Jim,"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her."
16778,Jim,That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
16779,Michael,What? What I'm saying...
16780,Jim,"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly."
16781,Michael,"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me."
16782,Andy," Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: ""Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way."""
16783,Andy,"Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you."
16784,Oscar,"What are we, five?"
16785,Andy,"""Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog."""
16786,Andy,It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
16787,Andy,"It's not... Whether or not, you..."
16788,Erin,"Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?"
16789,Michael,"Oh, it smells good in here."
16790,Erin,"Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator."
16791,Michael,"Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?"
16792,Dwight,"Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what? Michael!"
16793,Dwight, I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
16794,Ryan,"Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel."
16795,Dwight,"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?"
16796,Ryan,I would love to.  Why not?
16797,Dwight,Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
16798,Ryan,"Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know."
16799,Dwight,"It is not ""farm boy swill,"" I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious."
16800,Ryan,I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
16801,Pam," I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks."
16802,Dwight,Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
16803,Jim," Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely."
16804,Dwight,"No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!"
16805,Pam,There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
16806,Dwight," Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay."
16807,Dwight,"I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd."
16808,Pam,"Kevin, you're such a gourmand."
16809,Kevin,"I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken."
16810,Kevin,"Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner."
16811,Kevin,I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
16812,Pam,"Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?"
16813,Kevin,I think it should be a surprise.
16814,Pam,"No, no. I still have time."
16815,Pam,"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor."
16816,Jim,"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO."
16817,Pam,"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors."
16818,Jim,"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy."
16819,Pam,I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
16820,Michael,"Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car..."
16821,Michael,"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money."
16822,Jim,"Michael, you shouldn't have done that."
16823,Michael,"Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office."
16824,Pam,"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?"
16825,Michael,"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too."
16826,Jim,"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty."
16827,Michael,"Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!"
16828,Pam,"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight."
16829,Erin,"Ooh, spooky. But why?"
16830,Jim,Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
16831,Pam,Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.
16832,Michael,"Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd."
16833,Angela, What are you looking at?
16834,Dwight,"I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out."
16835,Jim, That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.
16836,Pam,"Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet."
16837,Jim,Are you serious? Pam.
16838,Pam,"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes."
16839,Pam,"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight."
16840,Andy,"Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate."
16841,Pam,Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.
16842,Jim,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart."
16843,Jim,"So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant."
16844,Pam,"Okay, stop watching me."
16845,Jim,"Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers."
16846,Jim,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?"
16847,Andy,"Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds."
16848,Erin,I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
16849,Andy,"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book."
16850,Jim,"You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet."
16851,Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore."
16852,Jim," Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals."
16853,Pam,"Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it."
16854,Michael,"Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!"
16855,Michael,"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. "
16856,Michael,The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
16857,Andy,Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
16858,Michael,I will allow that.
16859,Andy,Yes! Can anyone do those?
16860,Jim," Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one."
16861,Pam,"Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking."
16862,Michael,"Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?"
16863,Pam,"Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request."
16864,Michael," Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that."
16865,Andy,I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
16866,Michael," That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay."
16867,Andy,"Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay...  You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance."
16868,Ryan," ""You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."""
16869,Erin, Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
16870,Dwight,"Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract."
16871,Dwight,It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
16872,Angela,You know I was thinking...
16873,Dwight,"Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one:  Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?"
16874,Michael," Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there."
16875,Kevin,"For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!"
16876,Jim,"Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know..."
16877,Pam,"Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times."
16878,Michael,"Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times."
16879,Michael,"Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one."
16880,Erin,"Um, stimulate the nipples."
16881,Michael,"Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle."
16882,Kevin,Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
16883,Michael,"Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?"
16884,Erin,"Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods."
16885,Michael,"Okay, the opposite of that?"
16886,Kevin,Stick spicy food up her butt.
16887,Jim,"Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now."
16888,Pam,"Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions."
16889,Jim,"Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry."
16890,Pam,Why don't you go do some work?
16891,Jim,"Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled."
16892,Pam,"I know, you don't like to be frazzled."
16893,Jim,"Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally."
16894,Michael,I think he is.
16895,Jim,"I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes."
16896,Dwight,Acceptable names include and are limited to: Ebenezer.
16897,Angela,No Star Trek names.
16898,Angela,What if it's a girl?
16899,Dwight,"Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male."
16900,Angela,Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.
16901,Dwight,"It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months."
16902,Pam,"Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital."
16903,Jim,"Ah, you know me too well."
16904,Pam,"Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?"
16905,Jim,"Did you say ""she?"""
16906,Pam,"I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad."
16907,Jim,Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.
16908,Jim,"Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man."
16909,Jim,"Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better."
16910,Jim,"Alright... Hey, did you change?"
16911,Pam,"Oh, yeah, my water broke."
16912,Pam," Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow."
16913,Michael,"Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?"
16914,Michael,"4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have s*x like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?"
16915,Pam,"No, not yet, Michael."
16916,Pam,"Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?"
16917,Michael,Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
16918,Oscar,That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
16919,Michael,What is October feast?
16920,Pam,"There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there."
16921,Kevin,"Our ultra feast menu's theme: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?"
16922,Pam,"Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it."
16923,Michael,"Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital."
16924,Jim,Alright. Time to go. Okay.
16925,Michael,"That's right, let's do this."
16926,Jim,Let's give it a shot.
16927,Pam,"Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine."
16928,Jim,"Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital."
16929,Pam,"They're not that bad still, babe."
16930,Jim,"Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital."
16931,Pam,"No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay."
16932,Jim,"Come on, Michael says we should go now."
16933,Michael,"Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out."
16934,Pam,"No, it's passing, it's fine."
16935,Pam,"Ah, no, it passed. It's good."
16936,Jim,You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.
16937,Pam,"Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine.  Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it."
16938,Jim,"Hey, are you kidding me?"
16939,Jim,"If anyone can do this, you can do this."
16940,Michael,You can do this. You can do this.
16941,Jim,"Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared."
16942,Jim,"The best news is, we're going to have a baby today."
16943,Jim,A really awesome baby.
16944,Michael,We're going to have a baby.
16945,Jim,So let's have it at the hospital.
16946,Jim,How are we doing on contractions?
16947,Pam,"Oh, God. Oh, no."
16948,Jim,"Michael, I told you."
16949,Jim,"No, I told you to warn me at five minutes."
16950,Pam,"Jim, we waited too long!"
16951,Michael,"I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon."
16952,Jim,"We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?"
16953,Michael,"We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?"
16954,Pam,I don't want to have my baby here.
16955,Michael,You're not going to. You know where you're going?
16956,Michael,"Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?"
16957,Michael,Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
16958,Michael,"I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!"
16959,Dwight,"No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops."
16960,Jim,"Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually."
16961,Michael,"No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it."
16962,Jim,"Alright, I have my wallet."
16963,Jim,"Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys?"
16964,Michael,Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
16965,Erin,There's nothing in it.
16966,Michael,"You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?"
16967,Oscar,"The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!"
16968,Dwight,Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!
16969,Michael,"No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please."
16970,Erin,I didn't know we had a tape measure.
16971,Jim,"Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here."
16972,Michael,Thank you! Wish me luck!
16973,Michael, Here we go! Here we go! On our way!
16974,Michael,"Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!"
16975,Michael,"No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot."
16976,Michael,"Dwight, what is the traffic like?"
16977,Dwight,Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!
16978,Dwight,This is where I saw that deer last week.
16979,Dwight,Right over by that fence.
16980,Michael,"Okay, go, go, go, go!"
16981,Dwight,"I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends."
16982,Jim,"Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon."
16983,Michael,"Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised."
16984,Pam,"Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on."
16985,Michael,"I'm texting about you, okay!?"
16986,Dwight,"Ugh, alright.  Let's move! ... What?"
16987,Dwight,Are you kidding me?
16988,Pam,"Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!"
16989,Pam,It has the birth song on it!
16990,Jim,"Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine."
16991,Pam,"Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack."
16992,Jim,"Okay, so what do you want to do?"
16993,Pam,I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
16994,Jim,"Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now."
16995,Michael,"Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go.  Ready?"
16996,Michael,"Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday."
16997,Dwight,Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
16998,Pam,Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...
16999,Dwight,I don't need a key.
17000,Pam,"Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the..."
17001,Dwight,"No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala."
17002,Pam,Dwight just listen! It's underneath... 
17003,Michael,"Do you have everything, guys?"
17004,Jim,"Michael, just go park the car."
17005,Michael,Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay.  I just did.
17006,Jim,"Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good."
17007,Michael,"Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go."
17008,Jim," Doing great, push again."
17009,Jim,"No, don't push. Pull. Pull."
17010,Michael," Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes."
17011,Michael,That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
17012,Andy,"Hey, have you guys seen her?"
17013,Andy,What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.
17014,Andy,"I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper."
17015,Michael,I think it's going to be any minute now.
17016,Michael,"Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?"
17017,Michael,"Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright."
17018,Michael," Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna..."
17019,Michael,"You're starting, you're kinda losing them."
17020,Jim,"Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God."
17021,Michael," Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?"
17022,Michael,Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
17023,Pam, She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?
17024,Jim,"No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each."
17025,Jim,Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
17026,Jim,"She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great."
17027,Michael,Thank you! Thank you!
17028,Pam,"Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months."
17029,Jim,Oh. Let me get it.
17030,Jim,I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.
17031,Michael,"Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma."
17032,Michael,"Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you."
17033,Michael,"Love you, as a friend."
17034,Michael,"Ooh, I want to hold the baby!"
17035,Pam,"Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first."
17036,Michael,"Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael."
17037,Jim,"It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here."
17038,Dwight,"Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work ."
17039,Michael,"There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family."
17040,Andy,This man has a gift!
17041,Michael,Who else here is single?
17042,Michael,"I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too."
17043,Michael,"Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  Who else? Come on! People, I know models!"
17044,Ryan,"Ha ha, plus size models, maybe."
17045,Michael,"Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single."
17046,Michael,"Andrew, what about you?"
17047,Andy,"Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing."
17048,Andy,"Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible."
17049,Michael,"Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love."
17050,Pam,Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
17051,Jim,We were just kids. What did we know?
17052,Pam,Doesn't she sleep here?
17053,Jim,I think we'll be okay.
17054,Jim,"Ready? One, two, three..."
17055,Pam,"One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down."
17056,Jim,"I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it."
17057,Pam,She's not gonna... Just...
17058,Jim,I got it. Alright.
17059,Pam,"I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything."
17060,Jim,"Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?"
17061,Pam,How does one do that?
17062,Jim,Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.
17063,Pam,"Do you want to try it, Jim?"
17064,Jim,I think you're good. Doing a good job.
17065,Jim,"Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam."
17066,Pam,I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.
17067,Pam,Even if she's not getting anything?
17068,Pam,No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.
17069,Pam,"She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up."
17070,Jim,It's going to be alright.
17071,Pam,Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
17072,Jim,"Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good."
17073,Erin, You wanted to see me?
17074,Michael,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?"
17075,Erin,"Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?"
17076,Michael,I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
17077,Erin,I don't know what to say.
17078,Kevin,"Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me."
17079,Michael,"Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?"
17080,Kevin,"Erin, would you have lunch with me?"
17081,Erin,"Michael, could I talk to you privately?"
17082,Michael,"Sure. Kevin, please leave."
17083,Erin,"I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy."
17084,Michael,Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
17085,Erin,I'm sure he'll be fine.
17086,Michael,"I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah."
17087,Michael,"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though."
17088,Erin,I don't want anyone to die.
17089,Michael,Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
17090,Kevin,She touched my shoulder.
17091,Jim,"Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there."
17092,Jim,You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.
17093,Erin,Did you grow up around here?
17094,Erin,"So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?"
17095,Andy,"Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like ""Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,"" or, ""What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?"" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, ""Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted."" ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous."
17096,Pam,"Um, yeah, that would be great."
17097,Jim,Yup. Really great. When's she available?
17098,Pam,"So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch..."
17099,Pam,"Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything."
17100,Pam,"No, I mean, it feels... pressure."
17101,Jim,Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
17102,Pam,No. It just feels like pressure.
17103,Jim,I think she will.
17104,Pam,"Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if..."
17105,Jim,We'll figure it out.
17106,Pam,"Okay. Aw, thank you."
17107,Pam,"Shoot, she fell off."
17108,Jim,"Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing."
17109,Pam,"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?"
17110,Jim,No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.
17111,Pam,"Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it."
17112,Jim,"Okay, I'll just go get the other guy."
17113,Dwight," Hey, what's up, kid?"
17114,Angela,Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
17115,Dwight,"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?"
17116,Angela,I look forward to it.
17117,Pam," Jim, Jim, get her."
17118,Pam,Get the baby. Get her. Come on.
17119,Pam,I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.
17120,Pam,"Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the ""C thing."""
17121,Pam,"Aw, we're doing it."
17122,Pam,We're really parents now.
17123,Michael,Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.
17124,Erin,I have really enjoyed our time together.
17125,Erin,I want to continue working on our friendship.
17126,Erin,Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
17127,Erin,"And, you're my friend."
17128,Erin,"And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe..."
17129,Michael,"Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?"
17130,Kevin,You said she liked me.
17131,Michael,"Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place."
17132,Kevin,I've dumped better than Erin.
17133,Kevin,"Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael."
17134,Michael,Lynn was as hot as Erin.
17135,Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you."
17136,Michael,"This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?"
17137,Pam,"Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!"
17138,Pam,Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.
17139,Pam,"No, not at all."
17140,Pam,"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di..."
17141,Jim,"We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00?"
17142,Jim,"Yes, car seat's right there."
17143,Jim,"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car."
17144,Jim,"Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me."
17145,Dwight,"Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so..."
17146,Dwight,"Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this."
17147,Dwight,"Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun."
17148,Dwight,"Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha."
17149,Dwight,"Alright. I'll call you, kid."
17150,Jim,Are you really sure we should be leaving?
17151,Jim,"But you hear the baby crying, right?"
17152,Jim,"Uh, it's in the lot."
17153,Jim,"Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back."
17154,Andy,"Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation."
17155,Andy,"The fax says ""Erin, will you have dinner with me?"" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number."
17156,Erin,"It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?"
17157,Andy,"Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired."
17158,Erin, You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.
17159,Andy,"Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax."
17160,Erin,You read the fax.
17161,Andy,I'm... I'm asking you out.
17162,Erin,"Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner."
17163,Andy,"So, it's a date."
17164,Erin,Yes. Do you have a day in mind?
17165,Andy,"Yeah, what day? What day?"
17166,Erin,Everyday is fine. Or...
17167,Andy,"Well, that, what's that one?"
17168,Andy,Okay. Let's do it.
17169,Pam,"Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it."
17170,Jim,Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.
17171,Pam,Hi. We did it.
17172,Jim,"You used my move, didn't you?"
17173,Pam,I used a variation of your move.
17174,Michael," There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick..."
17175,Dwight,"Two forms of ID, please."
17176,Angela,"And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it?"
17177,Angela,Alright. How would you like to celebrate?
17178,Dwight,Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick...  I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.
17179,Michael,Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra!  Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
17180,Ryan,"Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups."
17181,Ryan,Why are you being so weird about this?
17182,Michael,"It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas."
17183,Dwight,"Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks."
17184,Jim,What do we got here?
17185,Dwight,"Surveillance, gaming- and business."
17186,Dwight,Okay. Come on! Jim!
17187,Dwight,"Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk."
17188,Michael,It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
17189,Michael,"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal."
17190,Michael,"Mm, that sounds great, actually."
17191,Michael,"When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!"
17192,Erin,Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!
17193,Andy,Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
17194,Andy,"Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to ""How I Met Your Mother"" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them."
17195,Dwight,Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
17196,Jim, Is this yours or mine?
17197,Dwight,They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
17198,Jim,Good Lord!  I can't believe I'm missing this.
17199,Pam,"It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic."
17200,Jim,Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. 
17201,Dwight,"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?"
17202,Jim,It is. Big time.
17203,Dwight,"Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now."
17204,Dwight,"What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on."
17205,Jim,Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
17206,Dwight,"I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father."
17207,Jim,Is that what happened to you?
17208,Dwight,"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother."
17209,Jim,That's a common mistake.
17210,Dwight,"Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending."
17211,Angela,Hey!  Are you sick?
17212,Erin,"Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion."
17213,Erin,"I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six."
17214,Michael,That is a great idea JB.
17215,Kevin,"Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap."
17216,Oscar,I have a question.
17217,Oscar,"In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?"
17218,Michael,"Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse..."
17219,Michael,"Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen."
17220,Michael,"Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!"
17221,Michael,"Well, I am heading down there."
17222,Michael,How about July 4th weekend? 
17223,Michael,"You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -"
17224,Michael,"All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on."
17225,Michael,Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
17226,Michael,"Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch."
17227,Michael,No is not an option.
17228,Michael,"All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no."
17229,Michael, I'll be over there.
17230,Jim,And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
17231,Dwight," Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you."
17232,Dwight,My headphones are broken.
17233,Dwight,Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
17234,Jim,Yeah that's great. Great.
17235,Dwight,"Okay?  ""The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"""
17236,Jim, When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
17237,Dwight,"""-But we'll be together then-"""
17238,Jim,Can you grow up?
17239,Dwight,"""-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then."""
17240,Jim, Whether it's this time or next time.
17241,Andy," ""The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon"""
17242,Jim,"No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--"
17243,Jim,"You know, can I call you back?"
17244,Jim,"That would be great, thank you."
17245,Jim," No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home."
17246,Jim,I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
17247,Erin,This fax came for you. 
17248,Erin,Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
17249,Andy,She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
17250,Andy,I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. 
17251,Andy,"No, no, no, no, no."
17252,Andy,I have some good ideas...
17253,Michael,"A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?"
17254,Michael,"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?"
17255,Michael,"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?"
17256,Michael,Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
17257,Michael,"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so."
17258,Michael,Mm. mm. Oh well.
17259,Michael,"No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope."
17260,Kevin,"Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous."
17261,Michael,How you doing stud? You already there?
17262,Michael,How's the lady situation?
17263,Michael,"Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late."
17264,Michael,Yeah. Maybe next year.
17265,Erin,I'm in my jammy-jams!
17266,Andy,"That's okay, I'm in my ""worky-works."" You look amazing!"
17267,Erin,"Oh, thanks. Come in!"
17268,Dwight,"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence.  No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. "
17269,Dwight,"Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening  I have..."
17270,Jim,"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay."
17271,Jim,"You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!"
17272,Dwight,"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week."
17273,Jim, Thanks again by the way.
17274,Andy,It is? I'm sorry.
17275,Erin,"Yeah, have some more blanket."
17276,Erin,"You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid."
17277,Andy,I didn't know you had a brother.
17278,Erin,He's my foster brother.
17279,Andy,"Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. "
17280,Andy,"Are we rotating seats, or?"
17281,Erin,"Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! "
17282,Andy,"So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?"
17283,Erin,None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
17284,Andy,All right. Formative years. 
17285,Andy,"Yeah, it's a kilt."
17286,Angela,"Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day."
17287,Michael,How late do we have to work tonight?
17288,Michael,Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
17289,Michael,"Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing."
17290,Michael,"There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees."
17291,Michael,"I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around."
17292,Michael,"Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship."
17293,Andy,Ooh. It's coming down out there.
17294,Erin,"Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here."
17295,Erin,I'm so sorry I was so sick. 
17296,Andy,"Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. "
17297,Michael,"Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!"
17298,Michael,Drinks are on me!
17299,Oscar,"No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!"
17300,Michael,Oh -hoh! All right.
17301,Michael,"Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, ""Don't worry, be happy."""
17302,Michael,"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?"
17303,Jim,Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem.  Thank you.
17304,Dwight,What the hell is this?
17305,Dwight,This is not Mega-Desk.
17306,Jim,"No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk."
17307,Dwight,"That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks."
17308,Jim,Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? 
17309,Michael,"Hey Jim, Jim. Come here.  Do you know who that is?"
17310,Michael,"Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans..."
17311,Michael, I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
17312,Jim,Where did you take that?
17313,Michael,In my condo complex.
17314,Jim,"Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton."
17315,Michael,"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie."
17316,Jim,Sure. That they should do one.
17317,Michael," Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?"
17318,Michael,"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim."
17319,Michael,No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
17320,Michael,"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?"
17321,Jim,At the Yankees game. Yeah.
17322,Michael,"Yeah. Well, it wasn't him."
17323,Jim,"I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp..."
17324,Michael,"I know, I know."
17325,Jim,...in your condo complex.
17326,Michael,I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
17327,Michael," First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -"
17328,Dwight,"Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?"
17329,Michael,"Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meeting's not over."
17330,Michael,No sales topic per se.
17331,Andy,Well then no Andy Bernard per se. 
17332,Dwight,"Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make."
17333,Michael,"I would like your undivided attention, please."
17334,Dwight,You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
17335,Michael,"Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order."
17336,Dwight,"Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier."
17337,Dwight,When I was asking about the leads.
17338,Dwight,... is there any news on the leads?
17339,Michael,Is that all you have to say to me?
17340,Dwight,"Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone!  Alright, Dwight out!"
17341,Dwight,"Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?"
17342,Angela,Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
17343,Michael,"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. "
17344,Jim,"Oh, sorry, wait one second."
17345,Michael,Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
17346,Jim,"This is actually a big potential sale, so..."
17347,Michael,You writing your memoirs over there?
17348,Jim,You writing your name over there?
17349,Michael,"Well, it's a pretty big check."
17350,Jim,"That's good. You know, with the kid."
17351,Michael,Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
17352,Jim,"Alright, here we go.  Michael..."
17353,Michael,"I'm just saying, that -"
17354,Andy," Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick.  Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy...  I'm making a sale. Sales."
17355,Darryl,There's other pencil's in this office.
17356,Michael,Honey and jelly sandwich time. 
17357,Michael,"Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. That's -"
17358,Darryl,I know who did that.
17359,Michael,You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
17360,Darryl,Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
17361,Michael,The sales department smashed my sandwich.
17362,Darryl,"Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them."
17363,Michael,You don't get it.
17364,Darryl,You need to get back on top.
17365,Michael,That's what she said.
17366,Erin,"Something came for you, Michael. "
17367,Michael,Thank you very much.
17368,Michael,"Ah, just the stupid leads."
17369,Michael,"Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. "
17370,Michael,"Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone."
17371,Michael,They act like I have no power.
17372,Michael,"Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that."
17373,Michael,"Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! "
17374,Michael,- and to King Meredith! 
17375,Michael,And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens .
17376,Michael,"I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis."
17377,Jim,"So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?"
17378,Jim,"Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?"
17379,Jim,"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?"
17380,Michael,"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?"
17381,Jim,I don't think you understand -
17382,Michael,I do understand it.
17383,Jim, This one's a map.
17384,Angela,"Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail."
17385,Angela,I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work 
17386,Angela,"It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them."
17387,Ryan,No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
17388,Ryan,"No, Stanley, do you -"
17389,Pam," Hey baby, what's up?"
17390,Jim,I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
17391,Pam,Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
17392,Jim,"Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more."
17393,Jim,Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  - that's just unfair.
17394,Jim,"How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'"
17395,Pam,"He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca."
17396,Michael,"Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally : 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldn't be in this business."
17397,Andy,Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
17398,Erin,Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.  I hid the leads.
17399,Erin, Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot.  Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
17400,Dwight,"What are you doing, idiot? "
17401,Jim,Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
17402,Dwight,Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it.  'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
17403,Dwight,The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
17404,Jim, It involves you too.
17405,Dwight,The leads are in?
17406,Dwight,"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in."
17407,Michael,"Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'."
17408,Dwight,"Kevin! Damnit  Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -"
17409,Kevin,You are never going to find them.
17410,Kevin,I'm going to enjoy this.
17411,Dwight, Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
17412,Kevin, I'm still enjoying it.
17413,Kevin,Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
17414,Dwight,"Turn the trash  It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress."
17415,Kevin,"No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen."
17416,Erin,I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
17417,Michael,Wait. What day is today?
17418,Kevin,"Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday."
17419,Michael,"Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!"
17420,Michael,"Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -"
17421,Michael,"Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump."""
17422,Michael,"Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -"
17423,Angela,"I'm not going. You did this, not us."
17424,Michael,"Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!"
17425,Darryl,"That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go."
17426,Darryl,I can't. You know that.
17427,Michael,"Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself."
17428,Dwight,"I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up."
17429,Dwight, This place has gone to hell.
17430,Michael,"You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me."
17431,Dwight,"Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak."
17432,Michael,"Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters."
17433,Jim,Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
17434,Jim,Just all the - drama.
17435,Jim,"Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?"
17436,Jim,"Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that."
17437,Jim,I have new baby pictures.
17438,Jim,She's wearing a onesie 
17439,Jim,Didn't we kind of start it?
17440,Jim,"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?"
17441,Andy,"All those who agree, say aye  All those opposed -"
17442,Jim,I don't think we need opposed.
17443,Dwight,"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?"
17444,Michael,"Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent."
17445,Dwight,Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
17446,Michael,"No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight."
17447,Dwight,"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -"
17448,Michael,Assistant to the managed him -
17449,Dwight,"Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!"
17450,Dwight,"Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere."
17451,Michael,You think you would have done better without me? Really?
17452,Dwight,I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
17453,Michael,Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
17454,Michael,"You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -"
17455,Dwight,Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
17456,Michael,"That's my wife you're talking about, man."
17457,Dwight,Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist?  You watch it!
17458,Michael,"If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you."
17459,Michael,"No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in!"
17460,Michael,Don't even think about that 
17461,Dwight," Stop it, get out! That's my spool."
17462,Jim,I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
17463,Andy,And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
17464,Jim,Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
17465,Jim,"Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it."
17466,Andy,"Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches""."
17467,Michael,"Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god."
17468,Michael,"We're never going to find those leads, are we? "
17469,Dwight," Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this."
17470,Jim,"No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody!"
17471,Jim,"No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry."
17472,Andy,Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
17473,Oscar,"Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move."
17474,Kevin,"Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell."
17475,Angela,Do you have any pastries without fruit?
17476,Jim,Yes! We do.  Eclairs.
17477,Michael,This  Why would somebody throw that out?
17478,Dwight,"Hey  You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?"
17479,Michael,"Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink?"
17480,Michael,"Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:"
17481,Dwight,We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. 
17482,Dwight,"Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only "
17483,Andy, It's freezing out here.
17484,Erin, Go on. I have warm blood. 
17485,Andy,"Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. "
17486,Oscar,Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
17487,Kevin,This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. 
17488,Kevin,No. I won't say it.
17489,Dwight,"Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique."
17490,Ryan,It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
17491,Dwight, Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
17492,Dwight,I love that show.
17493,Dwight,"That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please."
17494,Kevin,"Angela, this is inappropriate."
17495,Angela,This is my favorite day.
17496,Andy,"It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin."
17497,Andy,"If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom."
17498,Pam,"It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off."
17499,Pam, Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
17500,Jim,I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
17501,Dwight,"Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die."
17502,Pam,"It's nice to see you again, Dwight."
17503,Andy, I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
17504,Michael,I'm going to give Erin $15.
17505,Erin,I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
17506,Michael,A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
17507,Andy,Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .
17508,Michael,She's kind of a rube.
17509,Andy, That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
17510,Michael,Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
17511,Andy, She's gonna be so psyched.
17512,Michael," Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day."
17513,Erin,"Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss."
17514,Michael,I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
17515,Erin,I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
17516,Erin,Just the two of us.
17517,Michael,"Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm..."
17518,Erin,"Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but..."
17519,Michael,"Okay, well, we'll figure something. "
17520,Michael," Okay, let's go to Hayworth's."
17521,Kevin,"Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that."
17522,Darryl,I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
17523,Kevin,"Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.  Happy Birthday."
17524,Darryl," Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum."
17525,Kevin,"They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me."
17526,Kevin," Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level..."
17527,Kevin,Thank you.  It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
17528,Kevin, Do my hands feel sweaty to you? 
17529,Michael, Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
17530,Erin,I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
17531,Erin,I would have chosen the 1490's.
17532,Erin,'Cause America was discovered.
17533,Erin," And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?"
17534,Michael,An age or month?
17535,Erin,"Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven."
17536,Michael,I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
17537,Erin,How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
17538,Michael,So how are things going with Andy?
17539,Erin,He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
17540,Michael,"Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo."
17541,Erin,Yeah I love that.
17542,Michael,"Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser."
17543,Michael,I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.
17544,Erin,Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
17545,Michael,Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
17546,Erin,Why wouldn't he tell me that?
17547,Michael,I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.
17548,Michael,"They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir?"
17549,Michael,"Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?"
17550,Erin,"Uhhhh, they were engaged?"
17551,Michael,What are you doing? What are you doing?
17552,Erin,"In the Foster home, my hair was my room. "
17553,Michael,"Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now."
17554,Michael, I'll have what she's having!
17555,Michael, Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
17556,Dwight,Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
17557,Jim,"Dwight, don't be gross."
17558,Pam,"No, no, he's right."
17559,Dwight,"Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy."
17560,Pam,"That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?"
17561,Dwight," All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me."
17562,Pam,"You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?"
17563,Dwight,Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
17564,Pam,What are you doing?!
17565,Pam,Give it back to me now.
17566,Andy,So... how was lunch?
17567,Andy,Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
17568,Erin,"I don't know. It was lunch, Andy."
17569,Andy,"Well, I know.  Just want... I mean... "
17570,Oscar,Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
17571,Erin,"God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy."
17572,Ryan,That's a little derivative.
17573,Ryan,"Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?"
17574,Pam,Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
17575,Jim,"Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. ""Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall."""
17576,Jim,"""Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies."""
17577,Andy,"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself."
17578,Michael,"You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.."
17579,Andy,I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
17580,Andy,"Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote  a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three.."
17581,Erin, I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
17582,Andy,Can we talk about this in private?
17583,Erin,I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
17584,Erin,Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
17585,Erin,Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
17586,Erin,Who are you?! I don't know you! 
17587,Kevin,"Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you."
17588,Kevin,"So if you need anything, I'm right over there."
17589,Pam," ""Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful."""
17590,Pam,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?"
17591,Jim,I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
17592,Dwight,"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making."
17593,Kevin,"""C"" is for suspension."
17594,Andy,Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
17595,Michael,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap."
17596,Andy,"I was going to tell her, just on my own time."
17597,Michael,"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret."
17598,Andy,"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things."
17599,Erin,"You want to talk to me, come to my desk."
17600,Angela,You embarrassed me earlier.
17601,Erin,Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
17602,Angela,You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
17603,Erin,I want to throw up just thinking about it.
17604,Angela,You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
17605,Pam,Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
17606,Pam,Yeah. And he worked here too.
17607,Erin,"It was Andy, wasn't it?"
17608,Pam,"No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants."
17609,Erin,I hope you find what you're looking for.
17610,Pam,I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
17611,Jim,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that."
17612,Dwight," Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done.  Gabriel, I apologize."
17613,Dwight, I kneel before you.
17614,Dwight,Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
17615,Erin,Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
17616,Andy,"Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill."
17617,Erin,How long were you guys together?
17618,Erin,A year? You were together for a year?
17619,Andy,Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
17620,Erin,I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
17621,Andy,I didn't see that movie.
17622,Oscar,Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
17623,Dwight,What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
17624,Kevin," Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person."
17625,Dwight,"""I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit."""
17626,Kevin,"""Ciao"" Right? ""Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee."""
17627,Erin,Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
17628,Michael,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?"
17629,Erin,I can't trust Andy anymore.
17630,Michael,Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
17631,Michael,"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis."
17632,Erin,"Oh, I like his butt."
17633,Michael,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: ""Hey! Hey Scott!"""
17634,Andy,"Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day."
17635,Kevin,I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
17636,Jim,"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice."
17637,Pam,"Yeah. ""I vant to count to ten""."
17638,Kevin,"But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers."
17639,Oscar,Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
17640,Pam,That would have been funny.
17641,Kevin,But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
17642,Michael," Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? ""Oscar. I am the Count."" Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster."
17643,Erin,"Buenos dias, Miguel.  Hello, Dunder-Mifflin."
17644,Michael,"No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor."
17645,Michael,"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun."
17646,Jim,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?"
17647,Michael,"Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!"
17648,Dwight,"Guten tag, Herr Michael."
17649,Dwight,"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid."
17650,Oscar,"Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um...  I should have been more specific."
17651,Oscar,Your office is full of genitalia.
17652,Michael," Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!"
17653,Oscar,"""That's what he says?"""
17654,Michael,"Damn it.  Ah, Angelo."
17655,Jim,"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee."
17656,Pam,"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like,  ""I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee."""
17657,Jim,"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that."
17658,Michael,Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
17659,Dwight,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs."
17660,Michael,I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
17661,Dwight,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?"
17662,Jim, That's a good point.
17663,Pam,This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
17664,Jim,Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
17665,Pam,"We have good give and take.  I give, he takes."
17666,Jim, I don't even know who you are anymore.
17667,Jim,"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim."
17668,Michael,Did somebody order a hooker over here?
17669,Michael,Hi. How are you?
17670,Michael,"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so..."
17671,Michael,"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today."
17672,Pam,"Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister."
17673,Angela,I knew it. You should see their baby.
17674,Jim," So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate  So it's a tradeoff."
17675,Jim,Hold on one second.
17676,Michael,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?"
17677,Michael,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
17678,Jim,None of this is time sensitive.
17679,Michael,"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May."
17680,Michael,"Okay, I have more of them."
17681,Dwight,"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing."
17682,Darryl,"I didn't say ""a'ight."""
17683,Dwight,How do I apply?
17684,Dwight,"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?"
17685,Dwight,Come here. Come here.
17686,Dwight,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?"
17687,Darryl,I like the sound of this.  Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
17688,Dwight,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?"
17689,Dwight,"Oh, man. White people, right?"
17690,Dwight,"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice."
17691,Dwight,"I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race."
17692,Dwight,I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
17693,Dwight,"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?"
17694,Dwight,You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
17695,Dwight,That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
17696,Michael,"I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white."
17697,Michael,"And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black."
17698,Michael,"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on."
17699,Michael,This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
17700,Michael,And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
17701,Michael,"Oh, thanks.  You're not bad, either."
17702,Michael,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
17703,Michael," You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?"
17704,Jim,"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work."
17705,Michael,"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam."
17706,Jim,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant."
17707,Pam,"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here."
17708,Michael,"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it."
17709,Pam,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
17710,Pam,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
17711,Jim,"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale."
17712,Pam,Who cares?  It's not that huge a sale.
17713,Jim,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale."
17714,Pam,"Don't act like you understood anything that guy said.  Good luck, wingman. "
17715,Dwight,How as being a minority affected you?
17716,Dwight,"Oh, good, and you resent this because..."
17717,Dwight,"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky.  Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house."
17718,Kevin, Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
17719,Pam,Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
17720,Jim,"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility."
17721,Michael,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?"
17722,Michael,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
17723,Jim,I don't... I don't think so.
17724,Michael,I think we could. 
17725,Oscar,I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
17726,Michael,"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes."
17727,Oscar,"Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money."
17728,Michael,Why don't you run them again?
17729,Jim,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
17730,Michael,"If she is, it's working."
17731,Kevin,"Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says ""no,"" then she is not interested."
17732,Jim,She does not like him.
17733,Pam,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
17734,Jim,'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
17735,Pam,I was after your money.
17736,Jim,"Well, the joke was on you."
17737,Dwight,Hey... what are you guys doing?
17738,Ryan,Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
17739,Dwight,"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview."
17740,Dwight,Ryan? What does he know?
17741,Ryan,It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
17742,Ryan,And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
17743,Dwight,"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate."
17744,Michael,So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
17745,Michael,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?
17746,Michael,I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
17747,Michael,I can't stop myself from kissing her.
17748,Kevin,"Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day."
17749,Andy,"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?"
17750,Kevin,"Well, why don't you shut up!"
17751,Michael,"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time."
17752,Jim,It is totally insane.
17753,Oscar,"Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker."
17754,Michael,Okay. What do you think?
17755,Kevin,"I think it's over, man."
17756,Michael,"Okay, some for, some against."
17757,Pam,"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely."
17758,Pam,Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
17759,Pam,"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt."
17760,Michael,I'm going with Pam's group.
17761,Michael,"No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck."
17762,Michael,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point."
17763,Dwight,"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America."
17764,Dwight,"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic."
17765,Darryl,"I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though."
17766,Dwight,Kelly is the only applicant.
17767,Dwight,"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back."
17768,Michael,We should have your contract done by Thursday.
17769,Michael,"Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too."
17770,Michael,I don't know. I think so.
17771,Michael," Okay. So... Oh, Donna?"
17772,Michael,Thank you so much.
17773,Michael," Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have..."
17774,Michael,All right. All right. Bye.
17775,Michael,And have a good elevator ride.
17776,Michael,"Oh, what's that out there?"
17777,Kevin,"Michael, how did it go? "
17778,Dwight,How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
17779,Erin,Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
17780,Dwight,"I wasn't talking to you, pale-face."
17781,Erin,I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
17782,Dwight,What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
17783,Dwight,"Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective."
17784,Oscar,"Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is."
17785,Dwight,I can protect you from Kelly.  Will you get out of here? Seriously. 
17786,Dwight,"Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program ""print in all colors"" initiative."
17787,Dwight,Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
17788,Dwight,"Caucasians, am I right?  Have a seat. I'll translate."
17789,Dwight,You don't know what you need. Just...
17790,Pam,"Hey, Michael.  How you doing?"
17791,Michael,I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
17792,Pam,"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you."
17793,Michael,She suckered you too.
17794,Michael,Was it the cleavage?
17795,Pam,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts."
17796,Andy,"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused."
17797,Erin,"Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?"
17798,Michael,God. She left this here?
17799,Michael,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
17800,Michael,Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
17801,Oscar,"It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened."
17802,Pam,She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
17803,Michael,"Yeah, I know. I know."
17804,Michael,I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. 
17805,Michael,Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
17806,Erin,"Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?"
17807,Dwight,"Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. "
17808,Dwight,"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?"
17809,Michael,You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
17810,Erin,Kelly got into the minority training program.
17811,Michael,"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed."
17812,Michael,"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did."
17813,Michael,You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!
17814,Dwight,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!"
17815,Jim," Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you."
17816,Jim,Yup. That's exactly what we did.
17817,Pam,"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, ""I will when you lose the baby weight."""
17818,Dwight,Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize.  Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
17819,Michael,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
17820,Michael,"Get back to work, Dwight. Please."
17821,Dwight,Fine.  Hey. Tap away. 
17822,Michael,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!"
17823,Michael,"Who enjoys the weekends?  Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have s*x. Did I say that? Yes, I did.  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out."
17824,Michael,"Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas."
17825,Pam,Stanley got to go.
17826,Michael,"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out."
17827,Andy,Walk around apple orchards.
17828,Darryl,Curl up with your favorite DVD.
17829,Michael,"We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's."
17830,Michael,"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, ""I wanna go to Mount Pocono,"" you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI."
17831,Michael,"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see."
17832,Ryan,Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
17833,Michael,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
17834,Pam,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
17835,Michael,"... and... we had s*x, too."
17836,Pam,That is right. Don't make any more of it.
17837,Michael,How do I not make any more of it?
17838,Pam,You could start by concluding this meeting.
17839,Michael,"All right.  And she won't say, ""I love you."""
17840,Andy,How many dates have you been on?
17841,Michael,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
17842,Oscar,That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
17843,Ryan,"Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?"
17844,Ryan,Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before s*x? Does she shower after s*x? Does she...
17845,Michael,"Yeah, she does all that."
17846,Pam,"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok."
17847,Pam,"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control."
17848,Michael,"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?"
17849,Pam,"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control."
17850,Michael,"Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world."
17851,Michael,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit."
17852,Jim,But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
17853,Michael,That's what makes it so wrong.
17854,Michael,"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me."
17855,Dwight,"Oh, God, that tickles. What did..."
17856,Michael, I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
17857,Dwight,I think I've got one for you. 
17858,Michael,This is you. How much do you charge?
17859,Dwight,"$100 a day, plus expenses."
17860,Michael,I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
17861,Dwight,I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
17862,Dwight,And you might not like how I find it. 
17863,Andy,"Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire."
17864,Andy,"Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important."
17865,Andy,"Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire."
17866,Andy,What are we gonna do about this?
17867,Andy,Let me know what they say.
17868,Darryl, Wow. That dude is good.
17869,Andy,What do you mean?
17870,Darryl,You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
17871,Darryl,Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
17872,Darryl,"Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said ""Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."" "
17873,Dwight,I work with Michael.
17874,Dwight,"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news."
17875,Jim,"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?"
17876,Michael,"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives."
17877,Michael,"It's comfort food, all right?  God."
17878,Jim,"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up."
17879,Michael,"I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says."
17880,Pam,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
17881,Michael,Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
17882,Pam,"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that."
17883,Michael,It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
17884,Pam,"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael."
17885,Michael,"God, this is so disgusting."
17886,Pam,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
17887,Pam,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
17888,Michael,"That's not true.  You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan."
17889,Michael,"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life."
17890,Jim,"You should stop this,  and you should call Dwight right now."
17891,Dwight," Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead."
17892,Dwight,It's all yours.  Ah! 
17893,Dwight,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?"
17894,Dwight,Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
17895,Dwight, Oh. Oh. Oh.  One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops.  You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
17896,Dwight,Get out of my way. Huh!
17897,Dwight,"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?"
17898,Dwight,"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked."
17899,Dwight,"Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! "
17900,Michael,You're back. What happened?
17901,Dwight,"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking."
17902,Michael,"No, what happened with Donna?"
17903,Dwight,"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. "
17904,Dwight,Put your fingers here.
17905,Michael,No. No! Are you sure?
17906,Dwight,"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there."
17907,Michael,Who eats eight protein bars?
17908,Dwight,People who don't trust egg whites.
17909,Michael,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over."
17910,Dwight,"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious."
17911,Michael,"What? No, she didn't say that."
17912,Dwight,"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was,  ""What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him."" And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly."
17913,Michael,I am not paying for that membership.
17914,Erin,Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
17915,Michael,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?"
17916,Erin,"Uh, no.  Wait, yes."
17917,Michael,"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, I'll talk to you later."
17918,Michael,I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
17919,Michael,"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want."
17920,Michael,"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it."
17921,Michael,"Well, you are boner-ific. "
17922,Michael,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?"
17923,Andy,What's up? I got your e-mail.
17924,Darryl,I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz.  Andy don't mess with me.  I'll figure something out.
17925,Darryl,Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
17926,Darryl,"It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was ""Andy,"" ""Problem,"" ""Eliminate,"" something. I don't know what it meant."
17927,Andy,"What? You don't know what it meant? How about ""Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?"""
17928,Darryl,Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
17929,Pam,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
17930,Pam,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael."
17931,Jim,"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?"
17932,Pam,No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
17933,Andy,Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
17934,Pam,"So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online.  This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night.  This photo was taken this morning.  It's Cece.  She's never gonna do anything wrong."
17935,Pam,"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related."
17936,Michael,Well it can wait. It can wait.
17937,Pam,I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
17938,Michael,Jim is her husband.
17939,Michael,"And they are having problems, so sh..."
17940,Pam,"No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love..."
17941,Pam,"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my s*x life with Jim."
17942,Michael,"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?"
17943,Pam, I need you to sign this! So bad!
17944,Pam,I love ... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. 
17945,Pam," You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing.  Are you a golfer?"
17946,Michael,"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?"
17947,Darryl,"Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself."
17948,Andy,Your text said 911.
17949,Darryl,"Glen, could you excuse us? "
17950,Andy,"I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire."
17951,Darryl,I can videotape it.
17952,Michael,Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
17953,Pam,I don't know who he is.
17954,Michael,God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
17955,Michael,"I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him."
17956,Pam,You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
17957,Michael,I have to hear it from her.
17958,Pam,You have to settle down first.
17959,Michael,I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
17960,Michael,I need to have her say...
17961,Pam,"Yeah, but you have to calm..."
17962,Michael,"I need to say, ""What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"""
17963,Pam,"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture."
17964,Michael,"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!"
17965,Pam," Hi, Michael, hi, Michael"
17966,Michael,You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
17967,Michael,Wouldn't that be fun?
17968,Michael,I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
17969,Michael,"Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert."
17970,Michael,"Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by."
17971,Michael,You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
17972,Pam, Did she see me?
17973,Andy," We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. "
17974,Darryl,You haven't even introduced yourself.
17975,Andy,"Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much."
17976,Darryl,You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
17977,Andy,Higher? Okay.  Recently certain events have come to my attention...
17978,Andy,Make it higher? Okay.
17979,Andy, I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
17980,Andy, May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger...  ah!  It's working.  It's... I knew it!
17981,Andy,"We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off!  Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing."
17982,Darryl,"I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore."
17983,Michael,The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
17984,Dwight," Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill."
17985,Dwight,"You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!"
17986,Dwight,No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
17987,Dwight,"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No!  You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate."
17988,Michael,"Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. "
17989,Michael,"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?"
17990,Michael,"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom."
17991,Michael,"Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice."
17992,Dwight,"You were being really funny, and then you went too far."
17993,Michael,I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
17994,Dwight,"No, hmmm... that's still..."
17995,Michael,"Okay geniuses, how would you do it?"
17996,Oscar,All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
17997,Ryan,Is there a curtain rod in the room?
17998,Jim,"Stanley, please, this is serious!"
17999,Angela,Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
18000,Michael,"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle."
18001,Dwight,"Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it: You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this.  Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together."
18002,Michael," Toby, just do it! God!"
18003,Dwight,"Ready, one bullet. And boom! "
18004,Pam,What flavors did you get? 
18005,Erin,It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
18006,Pam, Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
18007,Erin,Do you want me to go back to the store?
18008,Pam,"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up."
18009,Erin,This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
18010,Pam,"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this."
18011,Erin,"After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me."
18012,Pam," Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this."
18013,Erin,"That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though."
18014,Erin,We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
18015,Pam,"And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up."
18016,Pam,"Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay."
18017,Pam,"No, out! Get out now! Leave now."
18018,Dwight,"Leave, get outta here."
18019,Pam,"Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?"
18020,Dwight,"Michael, nice tie or something."
18021,Michael,"Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. "
18022,Pam,That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
18023,Michael,"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?"
18024,Michael,Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
18025,Angela,"Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract."
18026,Angela,Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
18027,Dwight,"Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah!  See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it."
18028,Dwight,"So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point ""B"", uh... the beet juice cleanse?"
18029,Angela,I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
18030,Dwight,How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
18031,Angela,"Dwight, look at my teeth. "
18032,Andy,No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
18033,Pam,Could he still be seeing her?
18034,Jim,So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
18035,Andy,"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big."
18036,Jim,Exactly. It happened in Big.
18037,Michael,"No, I gotta go. Text me later."
18038,Jim,I'm really too tired to do this.
18039,Jim,Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
18040,Pam,"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby."
18041,Jim,We can order in from Hooters.
18042,Michael,"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice."
18043,Pam,We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
18044,Jim,Billy Joel Rock Band.
18045,Michael,"Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer."
18046,Pam," Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?"
18047,Michael,"Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions."
18048,Michael,Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
18049,Michael,"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong."
18050,Michael,"Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith."
18051,Michael,"People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers."
18052,Michael,"I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer."
18053,Andy,How does he feel about it?
18054,Michael,He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
18055,Jim,Now you're just being hurtful.
18056,Michael,"I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat..."
18057,Michael,On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
18058,Andy,Did Donna tell you that?
18059,Michael,Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
18060,Andy,So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
18061,Michael,You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
18062,Andy,"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage."
18063,Andy,So... here's the thing about infidelity.
18064,Michael,"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy."
18065,Andy,How does that work?
18066,Michael,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
18067,Andy,"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce."
18068,Michael,I am Beyonce always.
18069,Andy,"This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is."
18070,Michael,I would love that.
18071,Andy,Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
18072,Michael,I have work to do.
18073,Andy,"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss."
18074,Michael,Let's go.  I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
18075,Andy, Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
18076,Michael,"All right, Andy, please."
18077,Michael,"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him."
18078,Michael,Right there. The coach!
18079,Andy,Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
18080,Michael,"Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?"
18081,Andy," And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain."
18082,Michael,"All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?"
18083,Andy,Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
18084,Pam,"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe."
18085,Pam,You were supposed to be the Lookout.
18086,Jim,"Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag."
18087,Jim,"Well, you were surprisingly restrained."
18088,Pam,We will be well-rested tomorrow.
18089,Jim,Excellent. Go for it.
18090,Jim,"Right? So, uh, let's uh..."
18091,Angela,Same page. Go to the next one.
18092,Dwight,Same page. Just keep moving.
18093,Dwight,Which we can't know.
18094,Dwight,And wake up in the future.
18095,Dwight,"I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it."
18096,Andy,Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
18097,Michael,You have no idea what you're talking about.
18098,Andy,I know it's like cricket.
18099,Michael,"You don't. No, no."
18100,Andy,"And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket."
18101,Michael,"You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, ""Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?"" ""High-five, Donna."" ""Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?"" ""Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit."""
18102,Andy,Seems pretty well liked by the team.
18103,Michael,"Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary."
18104,Andy,You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
18105,Michael,"I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism."
18106,Dwight,"$30,000? There's gotta be another way."
18107,Angela,He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
18108,Dwight,"Look, I will not pay."
18109,Angela,"Well, I have an alternative."
18110,Dwight,"""Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"""
18111,Dwight,"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses."
18112,Dwight,But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
18113,Angela,"Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy."
18114,Angela,I want eye contact.
18115,Dwight,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
18116,Angela,I'm not some farm animal. 
18117,Michael,"Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't."
18118,Andy,You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
18119,Andy,Ha. The other guys can go die.
18120,Andy,Baseball! Go talk to him.
18121,Michael,No. God. You go talk to him.
18122,Andy,Shane. Great game man!
18123,Andy,"No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us."
18124,Andy,Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. 
18125,Andy,"But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot."
18126,Andy,Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
18127,Andy,"I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person."
18128,Andy,"I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife."
18129,Andy,"But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!"
18130,Andy,"Come on, get over here."
18131,Michael,"I'm good. Oh, my God."
18132,Andy,"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach."
18133,Michael,Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
18134,Michael,"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, ""I'm sleeping with your wife."" And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond."
18135,Michael,"Okay, orange slices. There ya go."
18136,Michael,Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
18137,Oscar,Why would you throw something wet at me?
18138,Michael,You love it. There ya go.
18139,Jim,"Now, were those for the team?"
18140,Michael,"Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks."
18141,Pam,I don't think those were yours to take.
18142,Michael,"Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane."
18143,Andy,"I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior."
18144,Pam,Did you talk to him?
18145,Pam,You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
18146,Kevin,Wow. That is crazy.
18147,Michael,No. We just talked. He's very nice.
18148,Michael,"I'm awful, aren't I?"
18149,Kevin,Yeah. That's pretty bad.
18150,Michael,I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
18151,Oscar,How can you live with yourself?
18152,Michael,"I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for."
18153,Kevin,"That is a dangerous game, friendo."
18154,Ryan,I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
18155,Ryan,"All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, ""I read a book about anthropology."""
18156,Ryan,I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
18157,Michael,"I don't care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon."
18158,Ryan,"Good for you, man. Good for you."
18159,Ryan,He takes what he wants.
18160,Ryan,"You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you."
18161,Ryan,You read my mind.
18162,Erin, Is this a joke?
18163,Ryan,"It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold."
18164,Michael,"You'll learn, baby. You'll learn."
18165,Dwight," I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong,  but they're no match for a grown Schrute man.    Let's see what she gets.   Aah!"
18166,Michael,"Yeah, I noticed that."
18167,Michael,I have got big balls.
18168,Pam,I don't think I'm gonna make it.
18169,Jim, What about an energy drink or something?
18170,Pam," It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later."
18171,Jim,"Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it."
18172,Pam,"Well, it does and it doesn't."
18173,Darryl,"Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place."
18174,Darryl,A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
18175,Pam,You sleep in the warehouse?
18176,Darryl,"Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?"
18177,Michael,"Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, that's...  All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna."
18178,Kevin,Why not your condo?
18179,Michael,"Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate."
18180,Andy,Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
18181,Michael,Nobody better try to stop me. Good. 
18182,Dwight,I could have stopped him.
18183,Dwight,Are you warmed up? 
18184,Dwight,"God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? "
18185,Angela,What did you do to yourself? 
18186,Dwight,Never mind. Just never mind.
18187,Angela,"Well, it better work."
18188,Dwight,"Oh, it'll work.  Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract."
18189,Michael," How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former."
18190,Michael," Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again."
18191,Michael,Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
18192,Michael," There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed.  Michael Scott, as seen on TV."
18193,Michael,"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!"
18194,Michael,"Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough."
18195,Michael,"Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site."
18196,Michael,"Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times."
18197,Jim,"So instead of working, you want..."
18198,Michael,Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
18199,Angela,"Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!"
18200,Dwight,"Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever."
18201,Michael,"Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up.  It's trying to stand up...  there it goes."
18202,Michael,Jo! We were not expecting you!
18203,Kevin,"Jo, I think that I know what happened."
18204,Kevin,"Well, now I think I might not."
18205,Michael,"Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office."
18206,Michael,"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand."
18207,Andy,"If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets."
18208,Andy,"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us.  Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?"
18209,Michael,"There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like..."
18210,Michael,"Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture."
18211,Michael,"We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda."
18212,Michael,"Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can."
18213,Michael,"I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right."
18214,Dwight,"Oh, sure thing, go ahead."
18215,Dwight,"Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?"
18216,Oscar,"The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother."
18217,Dwight,"You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide."
18218,Kevin,"Wait, are they searching all our computers?"
18219,Kevin,"No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner."
18220,Angela,"Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!"
18221,Michael,"Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers."
18222,Dwight,"Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here...  You should fire the following people."
18223,Dwight,Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
18224,Dwight,Are you referring to alchemy?
18225,Dwight,I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
18226,Michael,Is there something that you would like to say to me?
18227,Michael,About talking to the press?
18228,Andy,"I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!"
18229,Andy,"Okay? I, I... didn't do it."
18230,Michael,I don't believe you.
18231,Andy,I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
18232,Michael,"That's a little much. All right, all right, all right."
18233,Andy,"I don't care, that's how much I swear!"
18234,Michael,"Okay, I believe you, I believe you."
18235,Andy,I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
18236,Michael,Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
18237,Darryl,"Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar."
18238,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no..."
18239,Darryl,"I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib."
18240,Michael,Oh my god. Was she cute?
18241,Michael,"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is."
18242,Jim,What was you? You were the leak?
18243,Pam,Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
18244,Pam,"She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!"
18245,Jim,Why'd you do that?
18246,Pam,Her husband's a reporter.
18247,Pam,"So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do."
18248,Jim,"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax."
18249,Pam,I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
18250,Jim,This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
18251,Pam,"I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!"
18252,Michael,"I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour."
18253,Michael,Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
18254,Pam, Yeah?  I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
18255,Michael,So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
18256,Pam,"Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it."
18257,Pam, I have never seen so many parking tickets.
18258,Darryl,"All right, this is just messed up."
18259,Michael,"No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think."
18260,Michael,What do we got?
18261,Pam,We're not going for yogurt.
18262,Michael,"It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew."
18263,Michael,"Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue."
18264,Ryan,"Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you.  I just sent myself a Woof. "
18265,Erin," Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1."
18266,Ryan,"Thank you, Erin. Woof!"
18267,Michael,"Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case."
18268,Pam,Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
18269,Michael,"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers."
18270,Pam,I don't think that's a good idea.
18271,Michael,Just don't say no.
18272,Darryl,"Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat."
18273,Michael,"That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just..."
18274,Pam,"Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe."
18275,Michael,Okay. You can count on me.
18276,Dwight, Let me give you a hand.
18277,Dwight,Ready?  Got it? Oh shoot. Got it?  Dwight Schrute.
18278,Dwight,Basement office? You mean like a lair?
18279,Michael,"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it."
18280,Michael,It doesn't matter what I know.
18281,Michael,"Well, deal with this. "
18282,Michael,Are you going to kill me?
18283,Dwight,"Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it."
18284,Michael," Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police."
18285,Andy,What? Based on what?
18286,Dwight,All right. Sounds good.
18287,Jim,"Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy."
18288,Andy,"Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim."
18289,Michael,I am not going to tell you anything.
18290,Michael,"Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch."
18291,Michael,"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down."
18292,Michael,"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly."
18293,Michael,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
18294,Kevin,"Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?"
18295,Andy,"Gabe, I told you all about the printers."
18296,Jim,"I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point."
18297,Pam,"Yes, it's totally obvious."
18298,Angela,"Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting."
18299,Jim,"Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally."
18300,Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and p0rn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch."
18301,Andy,You're going to believe that guy?
18302,Michael,"You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you."
18303,Michael,"I, I surely do, and don't call me honey.  You were playing too."
18304,Dwight,"I'm about to buy this building, you know."
18305,Dwight,"Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace."
18306,Andy,"Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?"
18307,Andy,"Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I..."
18308,Kevin," No, it does not!"
18309,Andy,"Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either."
18310,Erin,I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
18311,Andy,"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do."
18312,Michael," We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?"
18313,Michael,"Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua."
18314,Ryan,This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
18315,Angela, I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
18316,Andy,"Go, go, go, go!"
18317,Andy," Toby, how did we do?"
18318,Andy,Whoo! We did it! 
18319,Michael,"I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did."
18320,Andy,"Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there."
18321,Andy,"And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher."
18322,Erin,Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
18323,Erin,"Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great."
18324,Andy,"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe."
18325,Pam, Hey. What are you doing?
18326,Dwight,"From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack."
18327,Kevin,"Well, what if you're cold?"
18328,Dwight,"Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy."
18329,Jim,"Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear."
18330,Dwight," Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration."
18331,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list."
18332,Oscar,The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
18333,Darryl,It says decaf. You get me decaf?
18334,Darryl,"My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him."
18335,Andy,"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father."
18336,Andy,"That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael."
18337,Michael,"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! It's not cappuccino."
18338,Oscar,He messed yours up to.
18339,Darryl,"He's got to go, Mike."
18340,Michael,"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?"
18341,Jim,"Wow, that's a lot of keys."
18342,Dwight,"The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man."
18343,Jim,"That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back."
18344,Jim,I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. 
18345,Jim,"Yep. Wait, and this. "
18346,Jim,"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life."
18347,Dwight," Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys.  Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim."
18348,Jim,"Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but..."
18349,Pam,It was really funny.
18350,Jim,"Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert."
18351,Michael,"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me."
18352,Michael,To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
18353,Michael,"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew."
18354,Michael,"Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest."
18355,Pam,Why is there a circle with a line through it?
18356,Michael,"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?"
18357,Michael,"No, it... Yes, okay, right.  All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. "
18358,Darryl,Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
18359,Michael,"Come on. Okay, um...  That's as clear as I can make it."
18360,Michael,Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
18361,Dwight,Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
18362,Michael,"Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke."
18363,Michael,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?"
18364,Michael,"No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew."
18365,Michael,Luke is my nephew.
18366,Oscar,"Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew."
18367,Michael,"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing."
18368,Darryl,What's wrong with a level playing field?
18369,Michael,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
18370,Jim,"Oh, man, so many points being made."
18371,Michael,"God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son."
18372,Erin,That's a really tight argument.
18373,Jim,But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
18374,Michael,"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?"
18375,Oscar,This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
18376,Michael,"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!"
18377,Oscar,"If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?"
18378,Michael,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, ""Wow, he is so great."" And I was gonna say, ""Well, it's in the genes."" And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is."
18379,Erin,Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
18380,Kevin,"Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?"
18381,Pam,Or enough for everyone?
18382,Oscar,"Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips."
18383,Andy,"Clutch cream run, bro."
18384,Pam,"Get whatever you want, on me."
18385,Jim,You really think you can make it up to me with food?
18386,Pam,I don't know. That usually works.
18387,Pam,"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right."
18388,Angela,I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
18389,Michael,"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!"
18390,Michael,"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store."
18391,Jim,"Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, ""I don't own an Ebay store,"" so..."
18392,Michael,"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project."
18393,Oscar,"Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday."
18394,Erin,"Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots."
18395,Michael,I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
18396,Andy,"You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A."
18397,Michael,"Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony."
18398,Oscar,"Yep, here they are."
18399,Andy,"This kid's costing us sales, Michael."
18400,Erin,"I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see."
18401,Michael,"No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit."
18402,Michael,Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
18403,Michael,You don't have all the facts.
18404,Michael,No. No. He's my nephew.
18405,Michael,"Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool."
18406,Michael,I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
18407,Michael,"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other."
18408,Kevin,"Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff."
18409,Pam,"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses ""Doors closed"" the doors open. Or he presses ""lobby"" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?"
18410,Kevin,Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
18411,Pam,Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
18412,Dwight,"Hey, did you SMS text message me?"
18413,Pam,"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on."
18414,Dwight," Okay, that's weird. Just hitting ""door closed."" What?"
18415,Dwight,"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us!  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol."
18416,Pam,Let's just calm down.
18417,Dwight,"Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately."
18418,Dwight,Use your talons! Pry 'em open! 
18419,Pam,"Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!"
18420,Dwight,"Well, don't look, freak!"
18421,Pam,"Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!"
18422,Dwight,I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
18423,Pam,You've gotta be kidding me.
18424,Michael,"Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no!  Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!"
18425,Michael,Give me the pointer.
18426,Michael,"No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously."
18427,Michael,"All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-"
18428,Andy,"Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye."
18429,Michael,"Okay, can I have that?"
18430,Michael,"Ok, I am going to count down from five."
18431,Michael,"Give-okay. Alright, give it up."
18432,Michael," You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!"
18433,Michael,"That's what you're going to do, Luke!"
18434,Michael,I had to do that.
18435,Michael,All right. Are we good?  You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
18436,Jim,You follow him on Twitter?
18437,Michael,"Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?"
18438,Pam,"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight."
18439,Jim,I did not do this.
18440,Pam,"I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video."
18441,Pam,"Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing."
18442,Jim,Do they call you that?
18443,Pam,They do call me that.
18444,Jim,"Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down."
18445,Pam,"Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor."
18446,Jim,"Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?"
18447,Jim,Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
18448,Pam,Stop drinking the water! Stop!
18449,Andy," No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah."
18450,Michael,"Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them."
18451,Andy, Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
18452,Michael,That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
18453,Michael,I can do that.
18454,Michael,Is there another option?
18455,Dwight,Wow. Late every day this week.
18456,Pam,We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
18457,Dwight,Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
18458,Dwight,"Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha  Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea."
18459,Dwight,Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
18460,Dwight,You remember my cousin Mose.
18461,Pam,Were you painting in the dark?
18462,Jim,Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
18463,Dwight,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
18464,Pam,I don't really think we need...
18465,Jim,Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
18466,Dwight,Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters.  I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
18467,Jim,These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
18468,Dwight,"Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork."
18469,Pam,And a soy sauce packet.
18470,Dwight,Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
18471,Jim,Don't beat yourself up.
18472,Dwight,"We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success."
18473,Jim,Who will be watching the children?
18474,Dwight,No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
18475,Jim,"Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works."
18476,Dwight,"Oh no, no, no."
18477,Jim,"But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good."
18478,Dwight,"I promise you, that door locks! "
18479,Michael,This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
18480,Michael,"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell."
18481,Michael,"I know what you want to ask me. ""Did your mom ever see you naked?"""
18482,Michael,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key."
18483,Dwight,"Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!"
18484,Dwight,"All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!"
18485,Ryan,America is one big mall.
18486,Jim,Did something happen Dwight?
18487,Dwight,"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim."
18488,Andy,"Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board."
18489,Dwight,You don't want to know.
18490,Pam," Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes."
18491,Pam,"I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok."
18492,Jim,Everything is going to be ok.
18493,Pam,Tell me I'm good at sales.
18494,Jim,You're good... you're good at sales.
18495,Pam,"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair."
18496,Andy,"Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the ""F"" word?"
18497,Dwight,Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
18498,Dwight,"Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're ""appearance""ists!"
18499,Jim,"Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?"
18500,Pam,"Yeah, what happened Dwight?"
18501,Dwight,"You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall..."
18502,Dwight,"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms."
18503,Jim,"Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly."
18504,Jim,"Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson."
18505,Andy,"No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you."
18506,Andy,Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner?  How about now?  How about now?  How about now?
18507,Michael,"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today."
18508,Michael,"No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time."
18509,Michael,"You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?"
18510,Michael,"Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby."
18511,Dwight,"Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl..."
18512,Dwight,"Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this s*x worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?"
18513,Jim,"No, no. I want to hear you tell it."
18514,Dwight,"Ok, Um... The s*x worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the ""trappings"" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going..."
18515,Andy,"Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like,"" I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me."" And the shop girl goes, ""ok"". And Julia Roberts goes,"" You girls work on commission, right?"" And the girl is like,""Yeah"", and Julia Roberts goes..."
18516,Andy,I was telling that... I was telling that.
18517,Pam, I am. I am the office administrator!
18518,Pam,"Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all."
18519,Pam,There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
18520,Michael,"Toby, can I really tell you anything?"
18521,Michael,"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my pen1s... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half."
18522,Oscar,Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
18523,Pam,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?"
18524,Oscar,"Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!"
18525,Pam,"Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?"
18526,Pam,"I get paid $40,000 per year."
18527,Pam,"No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500."
18528,Jim,"Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman."
18529,Andy,A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
18530,Jim,"No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?"
18531,Oscar,Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
18532,Dwight,Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
18533,Ryan,The glasses are a little... 
18534,Ryan,"Yeah, I liked them too."
18535,Darryl,"Say stuff like, ""Good morning, Good Afternoon"". People appreciate that."
18536,Dwight,"Wait, I see you every day. Can I say ""Good month?"""
18537,Darryl,I'm telling you how to do this man.
18538,Andy,"If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you."
18539,Andy, I think he's got it!
18540,Michael,"And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? "
18541,Michael,"Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. We're half way done."
18542,Pam,"Hey, do you have a second?"
18543,Pam,"Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over."
18544,Pam,"And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you."
18545,Pam,I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
18546,Pam,Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
18547,Jim,"We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute."
18548,Erin,"Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today."
18549,Michael,This is plenty complicated.
18550,Michael,I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
18551,Michael,"Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married."
18552,Michael,"Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though."
18553,Michael,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager."
18554,Angela,My place tonight. Wear this. 
18555,Dwight,Do you have your card?
18556,Angela,Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
18557,Michael,"I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid."
18558,Michael,I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
18559,Michael,Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
18560,Michael,"When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so..."
18561,Michael,"Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok."
18562,Michael,You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
18563,Michael,You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
18564,Michael,You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning.
18565,Pam,"Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to... "
18566,Pam,"There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone."
18567,Darryl,I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
18568,Pam,We can do that.
18569,Pam,So weird that there is no paperwork.
18570,Pam,"Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America."
18571,Pam,"Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe."
18572,Pam,"Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle."
18573,Pam,I'll get it right away.
18574,Pam,"The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards."
18575,Jim,Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
18576,Dwight,It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
18577,Jim,"Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that."
18578,Dwight,Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
18579,Dwight,"I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me."
18580,Dwight,"You work on commission, don't you?"
18581,Jim,Did you just say you remember him?
18582,Jim,What does that mean?
18583,Dwight,It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
18584,Dwight,Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
18585,Dwight,You made a big mistake. Huge!
18586,Jim,There it is. Alright.
18587,Dwight, I'll take the wizard!
18588,Michael,You forged them! You forged the forms!
18589,Michael,"Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake."
18590,Michael,"You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet...  ""I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!""  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!"
18591,Erin,Did you write this?
18592,Angela,What the hell is happening?
18593,Andy,We're the cast of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
18594,Michael, That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
18595,Andy,Like a month ago.
18596,Michael,Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
18597,Andy,Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
18598,Erin,I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
18599,Andy,What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
18600,Andy,"Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes."
18601,Erin,"Oh, who else is going?"
18602,Erin,Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
18603,Andy,"What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?"
18604,Michael,"Andy, what time's the show?"
18605,Michael,How long is it?
18606,Michael,"Nope, can't make it."
18607,Michael,"They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine."
18608,Andy,"Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?"
18609,Pam,"Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry."
18610,Dwight,"Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap."
18611,Andy,It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
18612,Michael,"I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?"
18613,Andy,"If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer."
18614,Andy,This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
18615,Michael,"I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play."
18616,Angela,"Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight."
18617,Dwight,"Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe."
18618,Dwight,Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
18619,Dwight,Give me the punch card.
18620,Angela,"No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show."
18621,Dwight,That is not in the contract.
18622,Angela,"Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?"
18623,Dwight,"Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape."
18624,Angela,"Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. "
18625,Andy,"Hey, how are those salads?"
18626,Jim,It's my own fault-
18627,Andy,"My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could..."
18628,Pam,"I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about."
18629,Andy,"Oh my gosh, that would be amazing."
18630,Jim,For a lot of reasons.
18631,Andy,"Yeah, I know. Neiche!"
18632,Michael,"I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers."
18633,Andy,"You all made it, thank you so much."
18634,Jim,"You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit."
18635,Erin,"I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club."
18636,Andy,"I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her."
18637,Michael, This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
18638,Darryl,"Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber."
18639,Michael,"No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber."
18640,Darryl,"No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition."
18641,Michael,Are you kidding me?
18642,Darryl,"Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later."
18643,Michael,"All right, I'm sorry. God."
18644,Dwight, I work with that guy.
18645,Angela, Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
18646,Dwight,Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
18647,Angela,"Oh, Dwight, just move."
18648,Dwight, His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
18649,Michael,You enjoy the second act.
18650,Michael,"Thank you. You, too. "
18651,Dwight,Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
18652,Angela,These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
18653,Pam,"Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!"
18654,Jim,We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
18655,Andy,"Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute ""break a legs"" or ""I still love you"" type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall."
18656,Andy,Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
18657,Andy,That monster of a judge has locked her-. Locked her away. 
18658,Michael,How is that funny?
18659,Andy,"Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. "
18660,Andy," You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But..."
18661,Andy,Do you think...  so you think... 
18662,Jim,"Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax."
18663,Pam," Oh, my God! Go, go!"
18664,Andy, That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
18665,Erin,I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
18666,Jim,"Okay, this was pretty simple-"
18667,Pam,Why are you here?
18668,Jim," Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed."
18669,Pam,"What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way."
18670,Erin,"I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything."
18671,Jim,"Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or..."
18672,Erin,"Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?"
18673,Pam,You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
18674,Erin,"Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want."
18675,Jim,"No, we're good. Thank you, though."
18676,Erin,"Okay. Alright, bye Cece."
18677,Jim,"Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again."
18678,Angela,That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
18679,Dwight,All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
18680,Angela,Where's my car? Come on.
18681,Michael,"Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots."
18682,Darryl,I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
18683,Michael,"Yeah, good job. Well done."
18684,Michael,"Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em."
18685,Michael,"Get your eyes checked, chucklehead."
18686,Darryl,You didn't have to boo him.
18687,Michael,"Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling."
18688,Darryl,How would you like it if we booed you?
18689,Michael,That would never happen.
18690,Michael,Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
18691,Michael,I don't like that at all.
18692,Erin,"Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!"
18693,Erin,"Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work."
18694,Erin,"Okay, I kill you now."
18695,Dwight,"All right, let's do this."
18696,Angela,"No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted."
18697,Dwight,"It's okay, I smell."
18698,Angela,"No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times."
18699,Dwight,"No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have s*x."
18700,Angela,"Well, I won't tell if you don't."
18701,Dwight,"I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you...  Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. "
18702,Andy,"These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here."
18703,Erin,"This is awesome.  Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup.  Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise."
18704,Jim, It's like The Hurt Locker!
18705,Pam,This night was a disaster.
18706,Jim,"No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream."
18707,Jim,We could put that in orange juice.
18708,Pam,Let's get our juice on.
18709,Michael,"Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?"
18710,Andy,"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
18711,Michael,"Yeah, I get those every day after work."
18712,Andy,It was like amateur hour.
18713,Oscar,"It was an amateur production, technically."
18714,Michael,"Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome."
18715,Andy,Stop just saying that.
18716,Michael,"I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse."
18717,Andy,Thank you. That feels good.
18718,Michael,I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
18719,Darryl,"Andy, sing us another song."
18720,Andy,"Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now."
18721,Michael,"Come on, Andy, seriously."
18722,Andy,"Okay, all right, all right, all right."
18723,Michael,"In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun!  I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy.  Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about."
18724,Michael,"No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act."
18725,Dwight," Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on!  Que? QUE?"
18726,Dwight,"I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada."
18727,Dwight,"Hola, tu es une buena worker?"
18728,Dwight,"Y el accento, donde are you from?"
18729,Dwight,"Ok, good. Me too, get in the car."
18730,Angela, Who's this guy by our cars?
18731,Dwight,"That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about."
18732,Dwight, I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
18733,Ryan,But if he doesn't?
18734,Andy,"Uhh, beg your pardon?"
18735,Dwight,When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
18736,Pam,No. No no no! 
18737,Andy,Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow! 
18738,Michael,There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
18739,Michael," Look,  It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive."
18740,Pam,"What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer."
18741,Pam,It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
18742,Michael,"Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it."
18743,Kevin,I know how you got it. 
18744,Kevin,Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
18745,Pam,"Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is."
18746,Kevin,I never seen herpes on you.
18747,Kevin,You have a pen1s?
18748,Andy,"Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?"
18749,Michael,Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
18750,Jim,"That was like, ten years ago."
18751,Michael,No! It was like four years ago!
18752,Kevin,"Michael, you're at least forty six!"
18753,Michael,Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. 
18754,Angela,This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
18755,Andy,"You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance."
18756,Oscar,I don't even wanna know these things!
18757,Michael,"How did this happen, how did I get this?"
18758,Dwight,"Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it."
18759,Michael,"You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port."
18760,Dwight,What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
18761,Michael,Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
18762,Michael,Oh my God! What if I did?
18763,Dwight,"You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes."
18764,Michael,Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
18765,Dwight,"You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do."
18766,Michael,There's no way I'm gonna do that.
18767,Dwight,"No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge."
18768,Michael,Hi Donna. It's Michael.
18769,Michael,"I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me."
18770,Michael,I can't even say it. H-I...
18771,Michael,"No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?"
18772,Michael,Does your stupid husband have it?
18773,Michael,Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
18774,Andy,"Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?"
18775,Andy,What do you mean again?
18776,Andy,Maybe like a year ago...
18777,Oscar,"Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions."
18778,Andy,"Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices."
18779,Andy,It's the world's only international sport! 
18780,Michael,No this is Holly.
18781,Michael,No this is Holly.
18782,Michael,Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
18783,Michael,Oh really? Was anyone killed?
18784,Michael, Were they in the missionary position? 
18785,Andy," Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na.  Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break."
18786,Michael, Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
18787,Michael,We would have twins. 
18788,Michael,Mhhmm! We would be married.
18789,Michael,I don't romanticize th-  No...
18790,Michael,"He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation."
18791,Michael,We were more than we were.
18792,Michael,"Ok, alright I gotta go."
18793,Dwight, He forgot to mention the herpes.
18794,Michael,It didn't come up organically.
18795,Michael,It's nice to see you doing so well.
18796,Michael,Bringing home the bacon.
18797,Dwight,I don't understand the reference.
18798,Dwight,"We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. "
18799,Michael, Would you excuse us...
18800,Dwight,"Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it."
18801,Michael,Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
18802,Andy,"So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. "
18803,Andy,"What, is it because he's black?"
18804,Jim,"Nope, it's because it's genitalia."
18805,Andy,Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. 
18806,Jim,Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
18807,Andy,"It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's."
18808,Michael,"Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!"
18809,Michael,Because we work together.
18810,Michael,Am I the princess?
18811,Michael," Ok, so I'm the guy at the station."
18812,Michael,I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
18813,Andy,"Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of s*x. Can anyone else name any other consequences?"
18814,Andy, Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
18815,Andy,"Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?"
18816,Andy,Then I will write it down.
18817,Andy,"I actually had that down in the cons column, but..."
18818,Andy,"Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk."
18819,Erin,"Andy, aren't there also negatives to s*x?"
18820,Andy,Yes! Thank you! Such as?
18821,Kevin,Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
18822,Pam,Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
18823,Darryl,"I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros."
18824,Andy,"Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column."
18825,Dwight,"Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you."
18826,Michael,"You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She..."
18827,Michael,"No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there."
18828,Dwight,"Wait, what Holly said?"
18829,Dwight,Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
18830,Michael,"I know, I know."
18831,Dwight,"Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay."
18832,Dwight,"TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!"
18833,Michael, Hi stranger! Long time!
18834,Michael,I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
18835,Michael,"Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?"
18836,Dwight,Come on old lady. Let's go.
18837,Andy,Who can tell me what the safest form of s*x is?
18838,Andy,"Incorrect, the only true form of safe s*x, ok? Abstinence."
18839,Darryl,Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski! 
18840,Andy,I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody?
18841,Pam,Andy that's way too personal of a question.
18842,Andy,"Well someone could answer if they want to.  Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil. "
18843,Oscar,Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
18844,Andy,"Well I'm not gonna use my pen1s, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway."
18845,Andy,I'm doing this for you Meredith!
18846,Andy,Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?! 
18847,Michael,Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
18848,Michael,"Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you..."
18849,Michael,"Real entertainers, like Billy Joel."
18850,Michael,"Carroll, how are you?"
18851,Michael,"I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her."
18852,Michael,He sounds like a nice guy.
18853,Andy,"I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith."
18854,Andy,How is that relevant to anything?
18855,Andy,The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
18856,Michael,Oh wow another living room!
18857,Michael,"You put the TV here, you put the family over here."
18858,Michael,Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
18859,Michael,"I just found out today. It's, uh, right there."
18860,Michael,I'm between specialists right now.
18861,Michael,Well I believe in love at first sight.
18862,Michael,"I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous."
18863,Dwight," Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?"
18864,Darryl," We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?"
18865,Andy,No I'm just sweating.
18866,Darryl,I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
18867,Andy,I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
18868,Darryl,"Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self."
18869,Darryl,"I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?"
18870,Michael,"Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye."
18871,Oscar,What is this about?
18872,Michael,"Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?"
18873,Michael,You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
18874,Dwight,It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
18875,Michael,I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
18876,Oscar,We were never lovers!
18877,Dwight,"I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had s*x with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms..."
18878,Michael,"Flower shops, fireworks celebrations..."
18879,Dwight,Fence with a hole in it..
18880,Michael,"Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park..."
18881,Dwight,"The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home."
18882,Michael,An electric car dealership. 
18883,Michael,Oscar! Think abou- Think! 
18884,Oscar,"I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning."
18885,Michael,She is a beaut!
18886,Dwight,Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
18887,Michael,"Oh, look at that.  Smooth roll."
18888,Kevin,You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
18889,Oscar,"No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses."
18890,Michael,"Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike."
18891,Jim,Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
18892,Michael,"I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!"
18893,Pam,"Come on, Michael! Yeah!"
18894,Jim,Just steer more now.
18895,Michael,Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
18896,Dwight,How do I look?
18897,Jim,Amazing. How do I look?
18898,Jim,"Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go."
18899,Dwight,"Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after."
18900,Dwight,"We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash."
18901,Jim,He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
18902,Dwight,Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
18903,Jim,I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
18904,Dwight,"And who is this ""the"" Steve Nash?"
18905,Jim,Phoenix Sun's point guard?
18906,Dwight,"No, Mr. Jock Hipster."
18907,Jim,"Well, I'm neither of those things, so..."
18908,Andy," Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!"
18909,Andy,"No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook."
18910,Andy,"""Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.'"""
18911,Andy,"Yeah, yeah, it's great..."
18912,Andy,"I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh."
18913,Dwight,Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
18914,Jim,"Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight..."
18915,Dwight,Danny Cordray is the worst.
18916,Jim,"Well, by worst, you mean the best."
18917,Dwight,"The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone."
18918,Jim,"So, the situation is the worst."
18919,Dwight,"Also, he slept with Pam."
18920,Pam,Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
18921,Jim,What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
18922,Pam,"That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle."
18923,Jim,"Yeah, I thought you started it."
18924,Pam,"No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago.  You know I have a kid with you, right?"
18925,Dwight,I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
18926,Jim,-I'm just gonna watch.
18927,Dwight," So anyway, she says, ""that is the biggest pen1s I have ever seen."" And I said, ""I know. That's why I brought you to the pen1s Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars."" Well, hello Danny!"
18928,Dwight,What are you doing?
18929,Dwight,Like hell you are.
18930,Dwight,"He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!"
18931,Michael,"Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?"
18932,Jim,"Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?"
18933,Michael,"Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?"
18934,Oscar,You are busy! We're in a meeting!
18935,Michael,"It's Jim, Okay? Yes."
18936,Jim,"Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here."
18937,Michael,"You need the big guns, yes?"
18938,Dwight,What'd he say? What did he say?
18939,Jim,The big gun thing.  Stop!
18940,Michael,"I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in."
18941,Pam,"You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager."
18942,Michael," No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?"
18943,Michael,No! Okay.  All right.
18944,Andy," Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?"
18945,Darryl,I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
18946,Andy,"Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com."
18947,Darryl,"If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?"
18948,Andy,I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
18949,Darryl,Nah. I play for pleasure.
18950,Andy,This is for pleasure.
18951,Darryl,I wouldn't enjoy that.
18952,Andy,I'm willing to pay you.
18953,Andy,Sixty bucks a session.
18954,Darryl,That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
18955,Michael,"Oh, no, that's a male model."
18956,Michael,"That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company."
18957,Michael,Nice to meet you.
18958,Michael,"Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?"
18959,Michael,Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
18960,Michael,"Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--"
18961,Jim,"Nope, not doing that."
18962,Dwight,I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
18963,Michael,"Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then."
18964,Michael,It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
18965,Michael,"When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-"
18966,Michael,"You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends."
18967,Michael,"And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now."
18968,Michael,"Shake it, shake it!"
18969,Dwight,Jim talked too much.
18970,Michael,"Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?"
18971,Michael,"How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned."
18972,Michael,"You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?"
18973,Michael,"Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?"
18974,Michael,"Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?"
18975,Michael,"I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?"
18976,Dwight,I know how we can learn his tricks.
18977,Dwight,What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
18978,Jim,Is that your office?
18979,Dwight,"Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell."
18980,Michael,You know what this is? This is a stinger.
18981,Jim,I think you mean The Sting.
18982,Michael,"Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers."
18983,Dwight,The Sting. The Sting.
18984,Jim,Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
18985,Dwight,Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
18986,Jim,Okay. But what is he more famous for?
18987,Michael,Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
18988,Jim,"You know this isn't real TV, right?"
18989,Darryl,"One second, one second, one second.  So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?"
18990,Darryl,But you're singing it.
18991,Andy,"Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto."
18992,Darryl,"No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song."
18993,Andy,"Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul."
18994,Darryl,"Oh, I never sing with soul."
18995,Kevin,I could sing it.
18996,Andy,I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
18997,Kevin,But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
18998,Andy,"Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-"
18999,Michael,"Oh, no, no. No. Don't-"
19000,Dwight,"People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire."
19001,Jim,"Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-"
19002,Michael,"Yeah, he is that good-looking."
19003,Dwight,"He's very, very handsome."
19004,Michael,"Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him."
19005,Michael,Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
19006,Andy, Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
19007,Oscar,It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
19008,Andy,But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
19009,Pam,Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
19010,Andy,"I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics."
19011,Ryan,I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
19012,Andy,Rude. And not helpful.
19013,Andy,"Well, that...really bums me out."
19014,Jim,We gotta get someone else in there right now.
19015,Jim,You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
19016,Jim,What do you mean?
19017,Dwight,"I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-"
19018,Jim,"Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?"
19019,Jim,So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
19020,Oscar,All right. I can do that. Then what?
19021,Dwight,Then make him pitch to you.
19022,Dwight,We gotta see what he's got.
19023,Jim,Exactly. You can do this.
19024,Dwight,"Okay, and remember-you're not gay."
19025,Jim,Stop it! It's gonna be great.
19026,Jim,"And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it."
19027,Jim,Who else we got?
19028,Dwight,Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
19029,Ryan,Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
19030,Jim,Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
19031,Michael,Don't let us down.
19032,Ryan, Will do.  Won't do.
19033,Jim,"No, no, no, no..."
19034,Dwight,"Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!"
19035,Michael,"Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop."
19036,Michael,"I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-"
19037,Michael,"Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever."
19038,Michael,"I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you."
19039,Michael,A surveillance room next to this one.
19040,Michael,Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
19041,Michael,"Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well."
19042,Jim,"No, no, no, no."
19043,Michael,"No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks."
19044,Michael,"You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me."
19045,Michael,"Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?"
19046,Michael,"Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?"
19047,Michael,"I know, I know."
19048,Michael,"Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?"
19049,Michael,"I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?"
19050,Michael,"Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!"
19051,Michael,"O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?"
19052,Angela,"Yeah, I can see that."
19053,Michael,No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
19054,Kevin,He's like a better-looking Andy.
19055,Michael,"No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me."
19056,Oscar,"It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it."
19057,Dwight,Can I talk to you about something?
19058,Michael,"No, you may not."
19059,Dwight,It's about this very announcement you just made.
19060,Jim,"Michael, I think you really want to talk to him."
19061,Michael,"Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave.  Don't leave. Don't let him."
19062,Michael,"Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?"
19063,Michael,"Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better."
19064,Michael,"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us."
19065,Dwight,Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
19066,Michael,"He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave."
19067,Dwight,Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
19068,Darryl,What's something you really care about?
19069,Andy,Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
19070,Darryl, Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
19071,Andy,Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
19072,Andy, Which me am I gonna be today?
19073,Darryl,Which me am I gonna be today?
19074,Andy,I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
19075,Kevin,Or the me that stinks.
19076,Andy,"Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?"
19077,Darryl,"Oh, don't worry about it."
19078,Andy,"So we're just, like, jamming as friends?"
19079,Darryl,"One, two, three, hit it."
19080,Andy,Closet full of mes-
19081,Jim,I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
19082,Dwight,"Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too ""meh"" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup?  We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!"
19083,Dwight,"Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay.  So...you're gonna be workin' here?"
19084,Jim,"Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?"
19085,Dwight,"It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. "
19086,Michael,"This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer."
19087,Kevin," Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?"
19088,Darryl,I'll be your croak monsieur.
19089,Andy, I'll be your croak madame.
19090,Kevin,"Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog."
19091,Darryl,I find you absolutely ribbiting!
19092,Andy,"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love."
19093,Andy,"What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now."
19094,Jim,I don't know.  Oh! That's... not... yours.
19095,Jim,"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?"
19096,Michael," All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!"
19097,Pam," Bye, Stanley! Love you! "
19098,Oscar,"So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?"
19099,Kevin,"The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore."
19100,Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?"
19101,Michael,"A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year!  Six seconds, MacGruber!  Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned!  Uh, two seconds MacGruber!  Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION!  MACGRUBERRRR!"
19102,Pam,"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!"
19103,Dwight," Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me."
19104,Jim,Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
19105,Dwight,To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
19106,Dwight,You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
19107,Pam,"I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on."
19108,Jim,"I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number  ...no."
19109,Michael,"Oh, here we go!"
19110,Michael, OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
19111,Michael,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?"
19112,Michael,"Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had."
19113,Darryl,Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
19114,Michael,"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man."
19115,Darryl,I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
19116,Darryl,What's under your shirt?
19117,Michael,Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
19118,Michael,Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
19119,Ryan,It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
19120,Oscar,"Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?"
19121,Kevin,You own a bar?
19122,Oscar,That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
19123,Ryan,"Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys."
19124,Kevin,I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
19125,Dwight,Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
19126,Jim,"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us."
19127,Pam,We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
19128,Pam,Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
19129,Pam,But I've learned to love again.  He's a cartoon sailor.
19130,Pam,And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
19131,Jim,"No. No, I'm not gonna-no."
19132,Andy,Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
19133,Kevin,I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
19134,Andy,You know what else?  The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. 
19135,Kevin,"Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe."
19136,Jim,Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
19137,Michael,Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
19138,Michael,"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please."
19139,Michael,"You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!"
19140,Darryl,"This is embarrassing, Michael."
19141,Michael,"Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed."
19142,Darryl,Let me put my shoes on. 
19143,Pam," Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it."
19144,Michael,This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
19145,Michael,"I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now..."
19146,Michael,And we are going to straighten this out.
19147,Andy,Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
19148,Michael,I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
19149,Dwight,He went to Gabe behind your back.
19150,Michael,"No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head."
19151,Dwight,He went over your head to go behind your back.
19152,Michael,What is taking someone from behind?
19153,Dwight,"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous."
19154,Michael,"It was a good idea, though."
19155,Dwight,Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
19156,Andy,"I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight."
19157,Kevin,"Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween."
19158,Andy,"We're just like, totally caught in the middle here."
19159,Andy,Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
19160,Kevin,They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
19161,Kevin,"Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you."
19162,Angela,"KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out."
19163,Oscar,Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
19164,Angela,"Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?"
19165,Angela,"This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book."
19166,Dwight,"Garbage magnet.  Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design.  I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!"
19167,Michael, What the hell are they talking about?
19168,Dwight,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique."
19169,Michael,"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?"
19170,Kevin,I am so sorry.
19171,Michael,What did you just thought?
19172,Kevin,"Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-"
19173,Kevin,I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
19174,Kevin,Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
19175,Michael,"Well, don't let it happen again."
19176,Kevin, You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
19177,Jim,That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
19178,Pam,"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history."
19179,Jim,It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
19180,Pam,"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so..."
19181,Jim,Oooh! You can't handle the truth! 
19182,Pam,"Yeah?  It was though, that's what happened."
19183,Michael,"Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other."
19184,Darryl,I'm not mad. Are you mad?
19185,Michael,You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
19186,Darryl,"Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you."
19187,Michael,"Okay, that might help. If you said ""I'm sorry"" in front of everybody."
19188,Michael,In front of me.
19189,Darryl,You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
19190,Andy,"Sookehhh.  Bill Compton, from True Blood."
19191,Oscar,I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
19192,Oscar,Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
19193,Ryan,"Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line."
19194,Pam,"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself."
19195,Kevin,Pam. Can you vote for other people?
19196,Michael,"Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!"
19197,Michael,Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
19198,Pam,"Michael, this is a bad idea."
19199,Michael,What's a bad idea?
19200,Pam,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?"
19201,Michael,"NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl."
19202,Oscar,"I present to you the  rational consumer, as it were."
19203,Pam,Angela as the nurse!
19204,Angela,"I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office."
19205,Michael,"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?"
19206,Jim,We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
19207,Michael,Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
19208,Michael,"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?"
19209,Dwight,Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
19210,Dwight,"I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth."
19211,Michael,If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
19212,Erin, A... S... S... H... E... T?
19213,Jim,"When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?"
19214,Jim,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is..."
19215,Jim,Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
19216,Ryan,Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
19217,Erin,Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
19218,Pam,I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
19219,Jim,Just tell her the real reason.
19220,Jim,Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
19221,Pam,"I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like ""gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why."""
19222,Pam,"Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know?  Okay. Well, excuuuuse me."
19223,Darryl,You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
19224,Michael,"If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!"
19225,Darryl,You said no to this one!
19226,Michael,"That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?"
19227,Darryl,What have you done for me?
19228,Darryl,What have you done for me?
19229,Darryl,Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
19230,Michael,"Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it."
19231,Michael,"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide."
19232,Darryl,I don't understand the point of a hat.
19233,Michael,I am not budging on the hat issue.
19234,Michael,Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
19235,Michael,"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call."
19236,Darryl,Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
19237,Michael,Sorry I was a jerk.
19238,Michael,Friends fight. Friends fight.
19239,Darryl,"Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?"
19240,Andy,"When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards."
19241,Darryl,This was your freshman year.
19242,Andy,"I started to ask myself, ""Do I have big plans here?"" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School."
19243,Darryl,No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
19244,Jim,"To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?"
19245,Jim, Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. 
19246,Pam,"Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez."
19247,Ryan,Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
19248,Pam,"I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat."
19249,Michael,"That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-"
19250,Michael," Um... kay. Uh, alright."
19251,Pam,One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
19252,Erin,Di-Did you say vampire?
19253,Pam,"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. "
19254,Dwight,Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania?  'Cause of the euro.
19255,Pam,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick."
19256,Pam,"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office."
19257,Dwight,"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life."
19258,Dwight,"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter..."
19259,Pam,I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
19260,Dwight,Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
19261,Jim,"So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you."
19262,Dwight,Yes. I would welcome it.
19263,Dwight,"The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever."
19264,Angela,Jim. Pam.  And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything.  I wish you both a pleasant day.  And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
19265,Pam,Cece's getting christened today.
19266,Pam,Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
19267,Michael,Top of the Sunday morning to you.
19268,Andy,"And a top of the day to you too, sir."
19269,Ryan,Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
19270,Michael,"Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo."
19271,Michael,"I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys."
19272,Andy,"Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids."
19273,Dwight, For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
19274,Michael, Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
19275,Pam,"Oh, Michael, this is just for family."
19276,Michael,But I'm the Godfather.
19277,Jim,"It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather."
19278,Michael,Are you talking to me?
19279,Michael,Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
19280,Pam,"Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather."
19281,Pam,"I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry."
19282,Michael, I'm not the godfather.
19283,Michael, So who is the godfather?
19284,Pam,"Our friend, Seth, and his wife there."
19285,Michael,"Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?"
19286,Pam,"No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later."
19287,Michael,"No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show."
19288,Pam,"Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael."
19289,Michael,"I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out."
19290,Ryan,"I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes."
19291,Dwight,"Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price."
19292,Pam, Somebody needs a change.
19293,Pam,"Well, she can't bring this up with her."
19294,Jim,"Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip."
19295,Jim," Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!"
19296,Pam,We have an extra outfit in the bag.
19297,Jim,No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
19298,Pam,You said you checked it.
19299,Jim,I did... say that.
19300,Michael,"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever."
19301,Jim,Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
19302,Jim,"Okay, ""A,"" Halbert. And, ""B,"" I think a more appropriate statement would be, ""The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."""
19303,Ryan,"For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?"
19304,Michael, How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
19305,Michael,I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
19306,Jim,"Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby."
19307,Angela,"Well, this is intimate."
19308,Pam,We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
19309,Angela,You don't know them all?
19310,Pam,"Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all."
19311,Angela,Jesus is not your caterer.  But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer?  They don't think.
19312,Pam, Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
19313,Jim,"Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?"
19314,Pam,I don't know. I'm just hungry.
19315,Jim,"Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry.  Sorry. I think I'm just hungry."
19316,Michael,"No, I insist. After me."
19317,Michael,Thank you. You too.
19318,Kevin,"I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?"
19319,Michael,"You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch."
19320,Kevin,"With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes."
19321,Ryan," Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts."
19322,Dwight,"Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold."
19323,Michael," Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey."
19324,Dwight,I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
19325,Michael,Are you kidding me? Stop it.
19326,Dwight,I'll call you back.
19327,Andy,What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
19328,Pam,"Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either."
19329,Pam,Who the heck was that?
19330,Jim,"I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic."
19331,Pam,We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
19332,Jim,All right. And cider.
19333,Michael, Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
19334,Oscar,Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
19335,Michael,"Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together."
19336,Darryl,We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
19337,Michael,Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
19338,Ryan,Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
19339,Michael,"No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month."
19340,Jim,"Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs."
19341,Michael, Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you.  Bye. Okay.
19342,Michael, Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
19343,Michael, I'll take a shirt.
19344,Michael,"If you'll have me, yes."
19345,Michael,Really?  Thank you. All right.
19346,Oscar, Michael. Get off the bus.
19347,Michael,"No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going."
19348,Michael,It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
19349,Darryl,I agree. I think it's superb.
19350,Michael,"You know what, my job will be here when I get back."
19351,Andy,"Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport."
19352,Michael,"Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them."
19353,Michael,Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
19354,Dwight,"Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?"
19355,Michael,"No, you may not."
19356,Erin,"I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave."
19357,Andy," Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!"
19358,Andy,I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
19359,Andy,Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
19360,Michael, See you in a few months.
19361,Michael,Mm. That's not gonna happen.
19362,Andy,We're one in a million.
19363,Michael,"Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So..."
19364,Andy,"Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals..."
19365,Jim," Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?"
19366,Michael,How long till we get to Mexico?
19367,Andy,"Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more."
19368,Michael,"Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?"
19369,Andy,"I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or..."
19370,Michael,Why aren't they building it themselves?
19371,Andy,They don't know how.
19372,Michael,Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
19373,Michael,"Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?"
19374,Michael,"What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?"
19375,Andy,"Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?"
19376,Michael,"Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday."
19377,Andy,And the Christmas party.
19378,Michael,And Cinco de Mayo.
19379,Andy,"Nah, no. We'll be back before that."
19380,Michael,"No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus."
19381,Jim,"Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?"
19382,Jim,"I don't know, dad. I don't know."
19383,Jim,"I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?"
19384,Jim,A small blonde woman?
19385,Jim,"Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!"
19386,Angela, What are you doing?
19387,Kevin, Give me the baby!
19388,Jim," Hi.  All right. Travel safe, Angela."
19389,Angela,Did you think I stole your baby?
19390,Jim,"What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you."
19391,Kevin," Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?"
19392,Angela,Someone put them in my bag.
19393,Pam,Did you lose Cece?
19394,Jim,"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did."
19395,Michael,Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
19396,Andy,I can make myself cry.
19397,Michael,Do that. Do it.
19398,Andy,"Should I-I got it. I got it.  Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view."
19399,Andy,"Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road."
19400,Michael," Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. "
19401,Michael,"Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please."
19402,Andy,Just make him stop the freaking bus!
19403,Michael,"Stop the bus, okay?"
19404,Michael,"I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take."
19405,Michael,We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
19406,Andy,"If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway."
19407,Michael,"Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?"
19408,Michael," Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you."
19409,Erin,Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
19410,Michael,Is anyone still at the church?
19411,Erin,"No, actually most of them went to go see a movie."
19412,Erin,"Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan."
19413,Michael,It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
19414,Erin,I bet. You guys.
19415,Erin,"Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?"
19416,Erin," They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. "
19417,Michael, They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
19418,Kevin,They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
19419,Dwight," They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats."
19420,Angela,"Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this."
19421,Jim,"Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all."
19422,Andy,"I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city."
19423,Kevin,No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
19424,Michael,"Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street!  Come on everybody! "
19425,Michael, There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! 
19426,Michael," Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught?  Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what.  You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship."
19427,Erin,"Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee."
19428,Michael," Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!"
19429,Erin,Yeah it's a TV show...
19430,Michael,Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
19431,Michael,Cancel it! Are you still here? 
19432,Erin,Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
19433,Michael,MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
19434,Michael,"I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry.  I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek."
19435,Michael,You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.
19436,Erin,"I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends."
19437,Dwight,Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
19438,Angela,I would watch that.
19439,Dwight,Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
19440,Andy, You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
19441,Erin,Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
19442,Erin,You and Michael are always the life of the party!
19443,Andy,Try and keep me from coming!
19444,Erin,Why would I keep you from coming?
19445,Andy,"Try and hide it, I will track this party down!"
19446,Erin,Why would I hide it! 
19447,Kevin,"Hey, you going tonight?"
19448,Michael,"Yes, I am. Are you?"
19449,Kevin,Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
19450,Michael,What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
19451,Kevin,No he's not the boss.
19452,Michael,Why did you just say he was the boss?
19453,Kevin,"'Cause, you're the boss!"
19454,Michael,Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
19455,Erin, It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
19456,Erin,Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
19457,Erin,Those posters used to be real French ads.
19458,Michael,"Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!"
19459,Michael,"Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. "
19460,Jim,You can't even do that.
19461,Pam,"Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night."
19462,Erin, The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! 
19463,Michael,"Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! "
19464,Michael,Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
19465,Michael,Well some of us are trying to have a...
19466,Michael, Well I will turn up the volume.
19467,Michael,"Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!"
19468,Oscar, That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
19469,Oscar,"You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book."
19470,Pam, Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
19471,Michael,"Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?"
19472,Pam,You have a gun in your desk?
19473,Ryan, Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
19474,Ryan,"What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic."
19475,Michael," Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated."
19476,Dwight,"Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first."
19477,Pam,Maybe I should go.
19478,Dwight," Kelly. Kev-  Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to?  In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby."
19479,Andy,Why does Erin like Gabe?
19480,Andy,"That's really nice, thank you."
19481,Oscar,Jim what are you doing?
19482,Jim,"Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores."
19483,Oscar,Flip it back please.
19484,Oscar,Go to the recorded version.
19485,Erin,I wasn't recording it.
19486,Erin,"Wait, why do you have to record it?"
19487,Oscar,This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
19488,Pam,If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
19489,Dwight,That would be nice wouldn't it?
19490,Pam,I can't even talk about it.
19491,Dwight,"You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours."
19492,Pam,I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
19493,Dwight,Really? Oh... Then here we are.
19494,Erin,"Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some  help so,  he was wondering if you could help him. "
19495,Andy," Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance!  Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?"
19496,Andy,My nanny used to wear that.
19497,Andy,"I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working!  I feel exactly like a seahorse!  Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub."
19498,Erin,Look who I found! 
19499,Michael,"Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find."
19500,Michael,Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
19501,Michael,"So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se."
19502,Erin,"Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,"
19503,Erin,Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
19504,Michael,He's the longest baby in this room.
19505,Erin,What's the longest thing you've ever seen?  For me it was the tale from Jets.
19506,Michael,You know what Erin you do have to.
19507,Michael, That's what she said. 
19508,Pam,It's a miracle. She loves him.
19509,Jim,"I don't know about, love..."
19510,Angela, Outside my car in two minutes.
19511,Dwight,"Well something's come up, I have to go."
19512,Pam,No no no no no! She'll wake up!
19513,Dwight,I have something to do.
19514,Pam,"Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?"
19515,Dwight,I do. But you married my worst enemy.
19516,Jim,Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
19517,Dwight,Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
19518,Jim,I don't think that's gonna...
19519,Jim,What kind of pizza would you like?
19520,Dwight,Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
19521,Andy," Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?"
19522,Andy,What does this say?
19523,Andy, Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball!  You throw a lovely party ma lady...
19524,Erin, Are you having a good time?
19525,Andy,Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
19526,Erin,Andy you look awful!
19527,Andy,You're four seasons in a day.  You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba-  Put if you put on a blue...  It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
19528,Dwight, Insert it in my mouth.
19529,Jim,That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
19530,Pam,"Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it."
19531,Dwight,I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
19532,Dwight,"No. Crust first.  Okay, now the beer.  Beer me Jim.  Ssss. Gentle.  Now I've gotta go meet Angela."
19533,Pam,"What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!"
19534,Dwight,"I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced."
19535,Jim,You need to stop talking.
19536,Dwight,"Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. s*x contracts exist!"
19537,Pam,Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
19538,Dwight,"Yeah sure, Jim could go see her."
19539,Dwight,You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
19540,Jim,"I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me."
19541,Pam,"No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela."
19542,Dwight,She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
19543,Pam,The reverse cycling ends tonight! 
19544,Dwight, A single piece of pepperoni please.
19545,Dwight,What are you doing?
19546,Kevin," I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!"
19547,Andy, Puts pillow in front of the puke.
19548,Andy,Do you think that they've ever...
19549,Andy,Well girls tell each other things right?
19550,Michael,I just went out for a walk.
19551,Michael,What? Really? That stinks!
19552,Michael,What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
19553,Michael,Are you kidding me?
19554,Michael,Now that's going on?
19555,Kevin,I can't believe we're missing that!
19556,Michael,"Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. "
19557,Kevin,"Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!"
19558,Erin,"Oh, uhm, like three months."
19559,Erin, I have to go Phyllis.
19560,Pam, Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
19561,Angela,What are you doing here?
19562,Pam,"I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone."
19563,Angela,Are you authorized to do this?
19564,Pam,Yes! I have been so authorized.
19565,Angela,"Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead."
19566,Angela,"Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?"
19567,Pam,"You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-"
19568,Angela,You know what Pam just save it.
19569,Michael,"No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah."
19570,Erin,Why don't you like him?
19571,Michael,"What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?"
19572,Michael,Why? I'm not your father.  All right.
19573,Michael,Go to your room.
19574,Michael,Go to your room young lady!
19575,Erin," Uhm, I'm not going to my room."
19576,Michael,As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
19577,Erin,I hate your roof!
19578,Michael,Oh do not raise your voice to me!
19579,Erin,I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
19580,Michael,"Gahh, I will pull this car over!"
19581,Erin,I hate it! I hate your car!
19582,Michael," If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family."
19583,Michael,"Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray."
19584,Andy,I accidentally ate some seahorses.
19585,Andy,"I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know."
19586,Dwight," Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up.  Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation."
19587,Michael," My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet."
19588,Jim,"Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work."
19589,Dwight,"Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero."
19590,Dwight,"Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one."
19591,Jim,"Okay, I'm not doing every number."
19592,Pam,"Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?"
19593,Michael,Uh... it was like eight years ago?
19594,Pam,"Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time."
19595,Erin,"Um, everyone was getting their driver's license."
19596,Jim,"Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?"
19597,Michael,"Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it."
19598,Andy,"I got it, try, um--"
19599,Michael,"You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended."
19600,Pam,"You're typing ""Big Boobs""?"
19601,Dwight,"Try ""Big Boobs"" with a ""Z""."
19602,Jim,That's--  the password. We're in.
19603,Michael,The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
19604,Michael,"I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back."
19605,Ryan,You should've sent me a WUPHF.
19606,Ryan," When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. "
19607,Erin,I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
19608,Erin,"Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--"
19609,Erin,But it's not for--
19610,Pam,"Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set."
19611,Michael,I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
19612,Michael,"I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop."
19613,Ryan,"Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company."
19614,Ryan,"We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way."
19615,Ryan,"New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today."
19616,Michael,Don't you work here full-time?
19617,Ryan," Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet."
19618,Ryan,"Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you."
19619,Michael,That does sound fun to me.
19620,Dwight," Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality."
19621,Dwight,"Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it ""Hay Place"". Eldred Called it ""Hay World"". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on!  Watch it, watch it."
19622,Dwight,Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
19623,Dwight,"Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!"
19624,Angela,"Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay."
19625,Dwight,"Roll in the hay, five dollars."
19626,Dwight,"Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot.  Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil."
19627,Dwight,"So, uh...  Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales."
19628,Jim," All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right.  Whoo! "
19629,Jim,"I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. "
19630,Kevin,Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
19631,Jim,"Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev."
19632,Kevin,"I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, ""dunh-duh-na-dah!"" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right."
19633,Angela,"You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero."
19634,Jim,What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
19635,Angela,It's a new corporate policy.
19636,Jim,"A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?"
19637,Michael,"Excuse me, everyone... s*x! Now that I have your attention..."
19638,Kevin,"You had me at ""s*x."""
19639,Michael,That's good to know. 
19640,Pam,"What do you want to say, Michael?"
19641,Michael,"Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan."
19642,Ryan,"Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. "
19643,Ryan,"For my current investors, things are going great."
19644,Michael,We already have a buyer.
19645,Ryan,Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
19646,Ryan,So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
19647,Oscar,"Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?"
19648,Ryan,"No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun."
19649,Oscar,What's your money situation?
19650,Ryan,"Well, it's tight, as with any start-up."
19651,Oscar,"Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?"
19652,Ryan,We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
19653,Andy,"I'm sorry, nine days until what?"
19654,Michael,"Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?"
19655,Oscar,How long do you think a week is?
19656,Michael,"No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles."
19657,Jim,"Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?"
19658,Jim,"Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything."
19659,Pam,Did you prank Dwight?
19660,Pam,"Well, you like that."
19661,Jim,"Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work."
19662,Pam,"I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own."
19663,Pam,Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
19664,Michael,Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
19665,Andy,Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
19666,Ryan,"Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend."
19667,Andy,You have his email?
19668,Ryan,"A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over."
19669,Michael,"Do not talk like that, Stanley."
19670,Pam,"Ryan, just tell us your plan."
19671,Ryan,"Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back."
19672,Dwight," Hey kids, was that fun?"
19673,Dwight,"Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. "
19674,Dwight,"Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose."
19675,Angela,Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
19676,Dwight,"Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?"
19677,Angela,"No, I--I think you should make time for it."
19678,Dwight,"Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?"
19679,Dwight,Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
19680,Ryan,"WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach."
19681,Ryan,"Everyone's like, ""Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?"" Or, Uh, ""Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!"""
19682,Michael,"""It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"""
19683,Ryan,"""Yo, Ry from WUPHF!"""
19684,Ryan,"""What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!"" WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!"
19685,Michael,Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
19686,Ryan,"The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever."
19687,Michael,"No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that."
19688,Ryan,"No, no, no, no, no."
19689,Ryan,I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
19690,Ryan," I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this."
19691,Ryan,The Washington University Public Health Fund.
19692,Ryan,"The domain name. Yeah, they do."
19693,Pam,I move we sell!
19694,Ryan,Have some faith in this idea!
19695,Michael,I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
19696,Ryan,"Yes. You alone do, actually."
19697,Michael,I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
19698,Angela,"Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place.  Don't laugh at me."
19699,Angela,"Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. "
19700,Kevin, You guys know how to get out? 
19701,Michael,"Can't talk, saving the planet."
19702,Pam,"Oh, we don't recycle."
19703,Michael,"We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?"
19704,Pam,I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
19705,Pam,"Listen, I know you really like Ryan--"
19706,Michael,"No, I won't even consider it."
19707,Pam,"Michael, I...  I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?"
19708,Michael,"Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor."
19709,Pam,"Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you."
19710,Michael,I think you are wrong.
19711,Pam,And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
19712,Michael,You may be right. I may be crazy.
19713,Michael,I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
19714,Pam,"Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing."
19715,Michael,I thought it might make me feel better.
19716,Michael, But it just may be a lunatic...  No.
19717,Jim," Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go."
19718,Ryan,"Michael, how's it going, bro?"
19719,Ryan,"Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there."
19720,Michael,"Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?"
19721,Ryan,"I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money."
19722,Michael,"Nine days, though. That's, like..."
19723,Ryan,"Look, I know I've tapped you so hard."
19724,Michael,"Yes, you have tapped this. Hard."
19725,Ryan," Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit."
19726,Michael,Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
19727,Ryan,"Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower."
19728,Michael,So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
19729,Ryan,Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
19730,Ryan,Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
19731,Michael,"Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so..."
19732,Ryan,I gotta work on this.
19733,Michael,Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
19734,Dwight,"And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred.  Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread.  And let's hear it for... Purebred.  Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick...  Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! "
19735,Dwight,Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
19736,Angela,"You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?"
19737,Angela,How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
19738,Kevin, Help! Hello?! Oh! Help!
19739,Andy,Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
19740,Andy,"If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell."
19741,Ryan,I'm betting on myself.
19742,Ryan,Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
19743,Andy,"All those in favor of selling, say aye. "
19744,Michael,"I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay."
19745,Michael,"I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground."
19746,Andy,You're gonna lose all of our money.
19747,Michael,"Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money."
19748,Ryan,"Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time."
19749,Michael,You can't have it.
19750,Ryan,Okay. I won't let you down. 
19751,Michael,"The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt.  Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So...  That's Uh..."
19752,Jim," All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again.  'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry."
19753,Dwight,"Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot.  Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. "
19754,Dwight,"I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter."
19755,Pam,You don't have to do that.
19756,Dwight," D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear."
19757,Jim," Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do."
19758,Jim,"Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong."
19759,Jim,"Well, A for effort right?"
19760,Andy,I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
19761,Dwight,"Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money."
19762,Erin,How was the dentist?
19763,Michael,It was great. China.
19764,Pam,"Are you okay, what's wrong?"
19765,Michael,"Everything here was made in China, Pam."
19766,Andy,"Yeah, its where they make stuff."
19767,Michael,"They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir."
19768,Michael,"Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more?"
19769,Dwight,China is on the move?
19770,Michael,"I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again."
19771,Michael,"My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight."
19772,Darryl,You gotta stop texting me so much.
19773,Andy,But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
19774,Darryl,You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
19775,Andy,Got it. Then I will call you.
19776,Darryl,"There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. ""I'm coming over baby."" And I would text back ""BTB"", bring that booty."
19777,Dwight,"I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is."
19778,Pam,"Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to..."
19779,Dwight,"Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner."
19780,Dwight,"""Which is you"" is not a sentence."
19781,Pam,"Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks."
19782,Dwight,"Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment."
19783,Pam,I'm not going to do that.
19784,Dwight,"Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy."
19785,Pam,"Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert."
19786,Pam,"Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight."
19787,Dwight," Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up."
19788,Pam," Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends."
19789,Dwight,"You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. "
19790,Erin,"According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese."
19791,Michael,So much for keeping our secrets up high.
19792,Erin,What's America gonna do?
19793,Michael,I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
19794,Michael,"Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes."
19795,Angela,You never told us to close them.
19796,Michael,Welcome to your future.
19797,Michael,"How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?"
19798,Pam,An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
19799,Michael,"Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin."
19800,Kevin,An antacid that you only take once a week.
19801,Michael,Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
19802,Kevin,Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
19803,Kevin,It's too big of a pill to swallow.
19804,Erin,"What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?"
19805,Erin,"I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing."
19806,Michael,I don't know what the  that was.
19807,Dwight,"I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve."
19808,Michael,"No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine."
19809,Oscar,"Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now."
19810,Michael,"No, no. That is right now."
19811,Oscar,"Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian."
19812,Michael,"In terms of land, not population."
19813,Oscar,Come on Michael. You can...
19814,Michael,"No, no you're wrong about this."
19815,Oscar,Where are you getting this information?
19816,Michael,I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
19817,Kevin,"Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?"
19818,Jim,"Okay, someone look it up."
19819,Ryan,I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
19820,Oscar,Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
19821,Darryl," ""Are you watching this?"" Seriously?"
19822,Darryl,I'm sitting right here.
19823,Ryan,Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
19824,Jim,"Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael."
19825,Oscar,Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
19826,Michael,So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what?  I don't care.
19827,Michael,"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?"
19828,Angela,Michael do something about this.
19829,Michael,"Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business."
19830,Pam,Dwight take it down.
19831,Pam,"I'm serious, take it down or else."
19832,Dwight,Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
19833,Pam,We can move out.
19834,Pam,"So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?"
19835,Jim,"Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?"
19836,Pam,I went out to look for a better office space.
19837,Pam,"Not really, because I found one."
19838,Jim,"Oh wow, these are nice."
19839,Pam,"Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room."
19840,Dwight,You can't just move out.
19841,Pam,"Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures."
19842,Andy, Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
19843,Pam,They're not of Cece.
19844,Pam,This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
19845,Pam,"Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak."
19846,Jim,"Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order."
19847,Oscar,Funny Jim. That is funny.
19848,Michael,Very comedically humorous Jim.
19849,Oscar,Alright. Alright I get it.
19850,Michael,Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
19851,Oscar,"He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing."
19852,Jim,"Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican."
19853,Darryl, Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
19854,Andy,Megan Fox! Come on!
19855,Darryl,"You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked."
19856,Andy,"Yes, but one good text away from a high five."
19857,Darryl,You accept these terms?
19858,Dwight,"In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list."
19859,Kevin,"Well, I wish for a million wishes."
19860,Dwight,"Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a..."
19861,Kevin,Then see you later building.
19862,Dwight,You can't possibly be serious.
19863,Kevin,I said see you later building.
19864,Oscar,I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
19865,Oscar,I'd love to talk more about it.
19866,Oscar,Maybe over some coffee later?
19867,Jim,"Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?"
19868,Andy,It is not just coffee.
19869,Jim,"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?"
19870,Andy,And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
19871,Michael,"Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary."
19872,Michael,"I'm pretty good on politics. ""California is bankrupt, and California, California.""  What?"
19873,Dwight,"Parley, my office, five minutes."
19874,Pam,So everyone here knows pirate code?
19875,Dwight,"Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap."
19876,Pam,You've been watering down the soap?
19877,Dwight,Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
19878,Pam,We need everything back the way it was.
19879,Dwight,"You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping."
19880,Pam,"That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. "
19881,Ryan,When was China founded?
19882,Jim,"Two for two, keep it up."
19883,Andy,"Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know."
19884,Michael,I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
19885,Jim,What do you know about boobs?
19886,Andy,"Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II."
19887,Andy,"This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!"
19888,Michael,"Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?"
19889,Andy,I'm like a quarter of the way through.
19890,Michael,Is it going to be worth it?
19891,Ryan,"Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet."
19892,Michael,I don't need to cheat.
19893,Jim,Show him how to use it.
19894,Dwight,"Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that."
19895,Dwight,There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
19896,Dwight,"She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam..."
19897,Dwight,I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
19898,Dwight,"So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?"
19899,Dwight,"Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go."
19900,Dwight,"I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam."
19901,Dwight,"Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office."
19902,Pam,"I know, because you're the reason we're moving."
19903,Dwight,"Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?"
19904,Pam,"Uhh, I think it's something like umm..."
19905,Dwight,What's the exact square footage.
19906,Pam,"Umm, let me see."
19907,Dwight,How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
19908,Pam,"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet."
19909,Dwight," You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say ""Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is."" I can't wait."
19910,Pam,I lied about some aspects of the building.
19911,Jim,It's still on a bike path though right?
19912,Pam,There's no building... it doesn't exist.
19913,Jim,What does that mean?
19914,Pam,"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna..."
19915,Pam,Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
19916,Jim,But you didn't fail.
19917,Pam,"And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales."
19918,Jim,And you didn't fail those things either.
19919,Pam,"Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?"
19920,Jim,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
19921,Oscar,"Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated."
19922,Michael,"Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?"
19923,Oscar,We have missiles too.
19924,Michael,"Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon."
19925,Michael,China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
19926,Oscar,"Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan."
19927,Michael,How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
19928,Oscar,Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
19929,Pam,"Hello, hello. You're breaking the law."
19930,Dwight,"Impossible, I love the law."
19931,Pam,"Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper."
19932,Dwight,"I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper."
19933,Oscar,"Don't worry about the coffee, its on me."
19934,Michael,"Yeah, I figured that."
19935,Oscar,"Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat."
19936,Michael,Wait. You forgetting something?
19937,Michael,"This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you."
19938,Erin,"Fire him. No, show mercy."
19939,Michael,"My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA."
19940,Michael,"I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation."
19941,Michael,Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
19942,Oscar,That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
19943,Dwight,"They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion."
19944,Darryl, Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
19945,Andy,Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. 
19946,Darryl,That's your new standard.
19947,Pam,Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
19948,Michael,"People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one."
19949,Jim,One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
19950,Pam,"Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge."
19951,Kevin,"Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'."
19952,Andy,Let's just jump in the air!
19953,Michael,That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
19954,Michael,"Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go."
19955,Jim,You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
19956,Dwight,"I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar."
19957,Dwight,"Let me see you jump.  Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that."
19958,Erin,I didn't want to miss it.
19959,Andy,"Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that."
19960,Oscar,Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
19961,Michael,"Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?"
19962,Michael,I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
19963,Michael,We didn't get it.
19964,Pam,"I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties."
19965,Pam,It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
19966,Jim,Why's it smell real?  Ah... good one.
19967,Michael,"Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! "
19968,Michael,How's everybody doing today?
19969,Michael,How's the party coming along?
19970,Michael,Are we over budget?
19971,Michael,No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
19972,Michael,"Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?"
19973,Angela,Nothing. Should be fun.
19974,Michael,"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?"
19975,Michael,"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?"
19976,Michael,"Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!"
19977,Michael,"My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama."
19978,Andy,Hello Kitty's for girls.
19979,Pam,Nashua got mp3 players.
19980,Darryl,I'll take one of those pink pouches.
19981,Darryl,"I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking."
19982,Dwight," Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful."
19983,Dwight,"Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!"
19984,Jim,"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?"
19985,Dwight,Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
19986,Dwight,You apologize to me right now.
19987,Jim,You've got something on your nose.
19988,Dwight,You apologize right now.
19989,Dwight,"Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter."
19990,Andy,That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
19991,Dwight,"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it.  Jim, let go. Let go."
19992,Kevin,"Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party."
19993,Angela,I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
19994,Angela,I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
19995,Oscar,Who are you dating in the public arena?
19996,Kevin,"Oh, right. The state senator."
19997,Angela,We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
19998,Angela,"Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. ""Angela...""  ""over here, Angela...""  ""here. Look here!"""
19999,Pam,"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that..."
20000,Pam,A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
20001,Pam,"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement."
20002,Michael,"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?"
20003,Michael,"Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!"
20004,Michael,"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?"
20005,Andy,Have we heard of it?
20006,Dwight,Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a s*x slave?
20007,Ryan,He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
20008,Ryan,He's rubbing his neck.
20009,Michael,That was the worst joke ever.
20010,Michael,"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye."
20011,Michael,"Hold on, Holly's coming back here?"
20012,Michael,"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?"
20013,Michael,"Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party."
20014,Michael,"You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree."
20015,Michael,Cancel. We're canceling it. 
20016,Angela,"No, don't throw those out!"
20017,Michael,"No, we have to cancel the party."
20018,Angela,We can save that.
20019,Michael,"No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new."
20020,Andy,These cookies are fine.
20021,Michael,It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
20022,Pam,"Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party."
20023,Michael,"Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine."
20024,Pam,"I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen."
20025,Michael,"You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work."
20026,Michael,"Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away."
20027,Michael,"We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool.  The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! "
20028,Angela,Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
20029,Michael,"Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa."
20030,Angela,Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
20031,Angela,"I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party."
20032,Michael,You never know about the press.
20033,Angela,"Well, I only ask because he's a senator."
20034,Michael,Could he help us with some parking tickets?
20035,Angela,I don't think that's appropriate.
20036,Michael,"Well, then he's not a senator."
20037,Jim,"We still doing the gifts today?  I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party."
20038,Pam,"Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year."
20039,Pam,"I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good."
20040,Michael,"Okay...  Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!"
20041,Pam,"No, it has the little..."
20042,Michael,"Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you."
20043,Michael,"Yes, that's me. Come on it."
20044,Michael," There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?"
20045,Pam,"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?"
20046,Kevin,"I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party."
20047,Pam,Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
20048,Andy,"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis."
20049,Andy,"I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup."
20050,Pam,"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him."
20051,Pam,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
20052,Andy,"I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup."
20053,Darryl,"Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine."
20054,Darryl,I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
20055,Darryl," Don't come in, I'm busy. "
20056,Andy,"It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too."
20057,Pam,"Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck."
20058,Andy,"Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back."
20059,Darryl,No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
20060,Pam,"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone."
20061,Darryl,"Hey...  You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it."
20062,Michael,"When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her."
20063,Erin,I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
20064,Michael,"She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know."
20065,Michael,What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
20066,Michael,"And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions."
20067,Dwight, You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... 
20068,Dwight,Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
20069,Dwight,I have no feeling in my fingers or pen1s. But I think it was worth it.
20070,Jim,"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh,  then...  ""How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight."""
20071,Erin,"I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive."
20072,Michael,"There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?"
20073,Erin,"Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry."
20074,Michael," Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old b*st*rd."
20075,Michael," Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?"
20076,Michael,"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!"
20077,Michael,"Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly."
20078,Kevin,Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
20079,Erin,"To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?"
20080,Michael,"Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party."
20081,Michael,"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk."
20082,Michael,What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
20083,Michael,This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
20084,Michael,"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy..."
20085,Michael,"Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?"
20086,Michael,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
20087,Michael,"Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie."
20088,Michael,You're kidding me. Ahh!
20089,Michael,What a douche bag!
20090,Michael,Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
20091,Michael,Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
20092,Michael," Yeah, Randy Newman's the best."
20093,Andy," Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree."
20094,Pam,"Hey, how about this one?"
20095,Andy,"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?"
20096,Darryl," I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think,  oh... pick a damn tree already."
20097,Pam,"Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too."
20098,Andy,"I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself."
20099,Darryl,"Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents."
20100,Pam,"Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents."
20101,Darryl,Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
20102,Pam,"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas."
20103,Darryl,How do I do that?
20104,Pam,"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun."
20105,Pam,You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
20106,Pam,"Hey guys, the tree's here."
20107,Andy,"Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so..."
20108,Oscar,Why would someone hug you?
20109,Michael,"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome."
20110,Michael,It's a sophisticated take.
20111,Darryl,"No, he doesn't.  I told her Santa would be here."
20112,Michael,"Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled."
20113,Pam,Who told you that?
20114,Michael,"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made."
20115,Pam,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?"
20116,Pam,"You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life."
20117,Erin,"Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away."
20118,Erin,"I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!"
20119,Pam,It doesn't really seem like you.
20120,Jim,"Don't. Stop, Dwight!  Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!"
20121,Dwight,"Oh, no. Oh, no!"
20122,Dwight,"Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!"
20123,Dwight,Huh? You like that?
20124,Dwight,"Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone."
20125,Jim,I just want it to stop.
20126,Ryan,There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
20127,Ryan,"We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest."
20128,Pam,"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?"
20129,Ryan,"Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?"
20130,Pam,"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or..."
20131,Ryan,"Well, it sounds like you know what you want.  It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?"
20132,Jim,You know what's crazy?
20133,Jim,I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.  Excuse me. 
20134,Michael,"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. "
20135,Angela,It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
20136,Michael,"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic."
20137,Dwight,I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
20138,Jim,What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
20139,Dwight,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing."
20140,Michael,"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City."
20141,Michael,I haven't told you about her.
20142,Dwight,I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
20143,Michael,"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, ""Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."""
20144,Michael,I do. She is.
20145,Michael,Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.
20146,Pam,"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion."
20147,Erin,That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
20148,Michael,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting."
20149,Michael,"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much."
20150,Kevin,"Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself."
20151,Angela,"No, it really seems like something Michael would do."
20152,Michael,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed."
20153,Andy,Why would anyone frame you for that?
20154,Jim,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole ""Woody came to life"" thing so quickly?"
20155,Michael,"Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?"
20156,Michael, I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
20157,Kevin,"Oh no, that's, that's not happening."
20158,Dwight,Dear God in heaven.
20159,Michael,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings."
20160,Michael,"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought."
20161,Dwight,"Okay, hey, hey, hey..."
20162,Jim,"No, fake girlfriends are always wrong."
20163,Michael,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, ""Michael, I love you, but I can't do this."" But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me."
20164,Michael,And we did this whole stupid party for you.
20165,Kevin,"Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!"
20166,Erin,I really think you're better off.
20167,Michael,"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?"
20168,Erin,Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
20169,Jim," ""Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.""  Damn it, Dwight!"
20170,Dwight,"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all."
20171,Pam,"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?"
20172,Andy,I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
20173,Darryl,"Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!"
20174,Pam,"Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?"
20175,Andy,No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
20176,Andy,Do you know the other state?
20177,Darryl,"Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold."
20178,Andy,"The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! "
20179,Darryl,And the game's over seconds later.
20180,Angela,I'm so glad you could come.
20181,Angela,"Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton."
20182,Oscar,"Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar."
20183,Oscar,"Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor."
20184,Erin,"I know who you are, and I think you should go."
20185,Kevin,"I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?"
20186,Michael,"Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome."
20187,Michael,"Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay."
20188,Michael,I am dead inside.
20189,Darryl,"What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies..."
20190,Oscar,Merry Christmas to you.
20191,Ryan, It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
20192,Angela,"I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation."
20193,Oscar,A real David and Goliath story.
20194,Ryan,"Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?"
20195,Angela,You are. You make your own drink. 
20196,Oscar,I'll make it. What are you drinking.
20197,Ryan,An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
20198,Oscar,I don't know how to make that.
20199,Ryan,"Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito."
20200,Angela,"And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest."
20201,Pam," I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe."
20202,Jim,"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. "
20203,Pam,Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? 
20204,Jim,"Ooh, go easy with the shaking."
20205,Jim,"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that."
20206,Pam,"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder."
20207,Jim,"Right. Of course.  ""The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert."" Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter."
20208,Michael,"Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip."
20209,Michael,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died."
20210,Pam,That's a sad story.
20211,Michael," Yeah, well, at least he was married."
20212,Pam,"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay."
20213,Michael,"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay."
20214,Pam,"I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over."
20215,Pam,"Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?"
20216,Pam,So just be patient.
20217,Michael,"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall."
20218,Dwight,I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
20219,Jim,Anything. You got it.
20220,Dwight,You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
20221,Dwight,I'll take that as a no.
20222,Michael,"I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it."
20223,Michael,"No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you."
20224,Michael, From the mall. That...
20225,Darryl,We wanted to give you something.
20226,Michael,Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
20227,Darryl,What do you say?
20228,Michael,"Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?"
20229,Michael,I think I know where he is.
20230,Michael,"You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?"
20231,Michael,All right. You have to pick up after them.
20232,Pam,"Hey, sorry. I'm ready."
20233,Jim,I don't want to go.
20234,Pam,"Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. "
20235,Jim,Have you ever seen 'em do that? 
20236,Pam,I'm sorry. I had no idea.
20237,Jim,"No, it's, it's okay. Okay."
20238,Pam,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no."
20239,Jim,Okay. This is it.
20240,Pam,"What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God!  Honey? Jim? Jim!"
20241,Dwight,"In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas."
20242,Dwight,"Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!"
20243,Dwight,This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
20244,Dwight,"Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us."
20245,Jim,"I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on."
20246,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!"
20247,Dwight,"What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh?  Dwight, don't be bothered by the . Over the line, Jim."
20248,Jim,"I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here."
20249,Dwight,"Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim."
20250,Dwight,Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
20251,Dwight,And the rest was just stuff.
20252,Dwight,Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
20253,Jim,"Oh, come on, that sounds awesome."
20254,Dwight,It was pretty awesome.
20255,Jim," Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now."
20256,Michael,"January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this."
20257,Michael,"Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down."
20258,Michael," Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not."
20259,Erin," Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry."
20260,Michael,"Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot."
20261,Pam,"Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board."
20262,Dwight,Wow. Did your baby draw that?
20263,Angela,The glitter is blinding.
20264,Pam,It's gonna be fun.
20265,Pam,"I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome."
20266,Michael,Sad. To soak up my tears.
20267,Erin,Gummi bears and gummi worms.
20268,Michael,"Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin."
20269,Michael,"Sad, something to break."
20270,Michael,"For you, job well done."
20271,Erin,Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
20272,Erin,And did you get the tickets?
20273,Michael,"I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. ""Hey, you think you can do my job better?"" I don't know. ""What's your name?"" Michael."
20274,Erin,"I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!"
20275,Pam,"Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board."
20276,Michael,So... high five me. We're back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
20277,Michael,"They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away."
20278,Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever."
20279,Michael,"Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes."
20280,Michael,Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
20281,Kevin,"Hey!  Right back atcha, bitch!"
20282,Michael,"Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!"
20283,Michael,I'm not listening to music!
20284,Michael,"Go! Oh, that's nice."
20285,Pam,"Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards."
20286,Dwight,I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
20287,Andy,"Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine."
20288,Pam,Learn to cook for one!
20289,Andy,"Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so... two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one."
20290,Pam,"Well, maybe you'll meet someone."
20291,Andy,"No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad."
20292,Pam,Make time for romance!
20293,Oscar,"Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'."
20294,Dwight,"Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that...  My resolution is... meet a loose woman."
20295,Andy,That's a good one.
20296,Andy,"You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too."
20297,Darryl,"You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. s*x already? Whoa...'"
20298,Darryl,"I'll come with you, show you how it's done."
20299,Darryl,"My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl."
20300,Michael,"Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!"
20301,Michael, E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
20302,Michael,I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. 
20303,Michael,"Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?"
20304,Pam,I don't think so.
20305,Michael,"When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?"
20306,Michael,But you did still love him.
20307,Pam,I'm not... I'm not going to have...
20308,Michael,Do you love him now?
20309,Pam,No! Just talk to her.
20310,Michael,"No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh."
20311,Michael,You think she'd talk to you?
20312,Michael,That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
20313,Andy,All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
20314,Dwight,I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
20315,Darryl,I got that cutie behind the counter.
20316,Darryl,"Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once."
20317,Darryl,"Holy , what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant."
20318,Andy,Let us know if you need anything.
20319,Andy,Why did we pretend like we work here?
20320,Dwight,Is that what we were doing?
20321,Darryl,"Hey, how'd you do?"
20322,Andy,We kinda nailed it.
20323,Dwight,"Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll."
20324,Dwight,Okay. What'd you get?
20325,Darryl,A book about oceans.
20326,Dwight,"Oh, really? What else? Let me see."
20327,Darryl,"No, that's uh. p0rn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... p0rn."
20328,Erin,I went to Portugal.
20329,Dwight,I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
20330,Darryl," Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh."
20331,Dwight,"Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time."
20332,Darryl,"I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that."
20333,Dwight,"Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women."
20334,Andy,"Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink."
20335,Darryl,What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
20336,Andy,"I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties."
20337,Dwight,"Chicks fall down, need help getting back up."
20338,Pam,The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
20339,Erin,"Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely."
20340,Pam,Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. 
20341,Pam,Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
20342,Pam,How is it going?
20343,Pam,"One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February."
20344,Michael,That's not a joke.
20345,Pam,"But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?"
20346,Kevin,"Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none."
20347,Pam,"Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine."
20348,Pam,"Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week."
20349,Michael,"Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere."
20350,Kevin,Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
20351,Michael,"What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!"
20352,Michael,You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
20353,Michael,Just do a cartwheel!
20354,Erin,This is all I could find.
20355,Pam,"You don't have to do that, Kevin."
20356,Kevin,"I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael."
20357,Kevin,"This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?"
20358,Kevin,Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
20359,Michael,"No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go."
20360,Michael,"Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it."
20361,Kevin,"God, I hate it."
20362,Michael,I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
20363,Michael,"All right, all right, shh!"
20364,Kevin,"All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?"
20365,Michael,"Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic."
20366,Kevin,"Can I get some candy, or something?"
20367,Michael,No! You can't have any candy!
20368,Oscar,I'll get him water.
20369,Pam,"Okay, Michael, just settle down."
20370,Michael,"Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there."
20371,Michael,"Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room."
20372,Michael,"And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax."
20373,Kevin,You were super mean.
20374,Michael,It was insensitive and I am sorry.
20375,Kevin,"It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again."
20376,Michael,"I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line."
20377,Kevin,"Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life."
20378,Michael,You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
20379,Michael,"Okay, oh! All right."
20380,Kevin,I'm going to help you.
20381,Andy,Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
20382,Andy,I said no hits!
20383,Ryan,"I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not..."
20384,Kevin,How's your fart project coming?
20385,Ryan,"That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?"
20386,Pam,"Kevin, don't! Come on!"
20387,Pam,"Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today."
20388,Erin,"One, two, three.  I did it! I did a cartwheel!"
20389,Andy,Hey! Where did you go?
20390,Darryl,"Why, did you meet someone?"
20391,Andy,"Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him."
20392,Andy,And where did you go?
20393,Dwight,Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
20394,Erin,You want to keep this?
20395,Erin,Do you want to keep this?
20396,Erin,Do you want to keep this?
20397,Michael,You can toss them.
20398,Michael,My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
20399,Michael,Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
20400,Michael,You ready to do this?
20401,Michael,You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
20402,Michael,It's about you. It's about you. Go!
20403,Michael,"Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow."
20404,Michael," Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate."
20405,Michael,"Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?"
20406,Michael,I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.
20407,Michael,I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
20408,Michael,"No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality."
20409,Michael,That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
20410,Michael,"No, not right now."
20411,Michael,All right. See you around.
20412,Michael,Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
20413,Erin,"Your first student is here, Mister Bernard."
20414,Andy,"That's actually ""Master of Ceremonies"" Bernard."
20415,Andy,"Last year, I went to a seminar called ""The Ten Secrets of Real Estate"". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients."
20416,Michael,"  Hello, I am here for the small business seminar."
20417,Michael,Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
20418,Michael,"I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character ""Mikanos"", is just a little added flava. ""Mikanos"" is loosely based on another character I do, ""Spiros"", who is more about the ladies."
20419,Andy,Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
20420,Jim,"Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win."
20421,Andy,Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
20422,Jim,"Wow.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar."
20423,Andy,"No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,"
20424,Andy,"If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night."
20425,Jim,I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
20426,Andy,You can't. You can't.
20427,Andy,"I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at."
20428,Jim,Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
20429,Pam,What's going on? Do you know that guy?
20430,Jim,"I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office."
20431,Dwight, How are the marks?
20432,Dwight,What are some of your small business ideas?
20433,Dwight,"That's great. There's a big, big future in that."
20434,Dwight,"Um, what about you?"
20435,Dwight,You promised us whales. These are worms.
20436,Andy,"They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter."
20437,Andy,"Stanley, you're suppose to close."
20438,Andy,What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
20439,Dwight,We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
20440,Michael,"You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and..."
20441,Michael,"Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it."
20442,Michael," If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?"
20443,Michael,Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
20444,Michael,"Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that."
20445,Erin," Down... there.  Is ""jlp"" a word?"
20446,Erin,"No, j-l-p. Like, ""I jlp... I jlp you!"""
20447,Pam,I don't think that's a word.
20448,Erin,"I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game."
20449,Erin,"The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen ""The Shining"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Ring"". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything."
20450,Pam,You want some help?
20451,Pam,"K-a. ""Ka""? What does ""ka"" mean?"
20452,Oscar,"It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play ""moo""?"
20453,Erin,"Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing ""moo"", I'm playing ""milk"". Whatever it takes."
20454,Oscar,"Okay, but look, you could have hit ""mood"". Would have played a..."
20455,Erin,Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
20456,Erin,The cow jumped over the moon.
20457,Oscar,She's stuck on that one thing.
20458,Pam,"No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?"
20459,Andy,"Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy."
20460,Kevin,"Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam."
20461,Andy,"Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great."
20462,Kevin,Then I won't let you down.
20463,Andy,"Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?"
20464,Andy,I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
20465,Andy,Can you do it?
20466,Ryan,Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
20467,Ryan,"No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment."
20468,Andy,"What do I put you down for, bro hombre?"
20469,Ryan,"Yes, I'll do it."
20470,Andy,"Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome."
20471,Ryan,"And if I flake, I flake."
20472,Andy,"Kevin, you open it up."
20473,Andy,"Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed: guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!"
20474,Andy,Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
20475,Andy,"Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, ""Don't Just Dream it, do it."" Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. "
20476,Kevin,There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
20477,Kevin, Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an.  And then double it! .
20478,Kevin,"No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner.  . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! "
20479,Andy,I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
20480,Andy,That brilliant little bitch.
20481,Oscar,"A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that ""q"" right there."
20482,Oscar,"Put the ""q"" there, sweetie."
20483,Pam,I think there's better...
20484,Oscar,"Put the ""q"" there!  Sorry I yelled."
20485,Pam,You could have just told us what you were thinking.
20486,Oscar,There's no theater in that.
20487,Pam,"There's no yelling in that, either."
20488,Michael," I like the musical ""Grease"", or as we call it, ""home""."
20489,Michael,She will have a greekaccino.
20490,Michael, I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
20491,Michael,No more brain damage!
20492,Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. "
20493,Andy," Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour."
20494,Erin,"We're gonna watch ""Wall-e"", where all the boundaries of color are pushed."
20495,Dwight,So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
20496,Dwight,Some of these people are for real.
20497,Dwight,"Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you."
20498,Dwight,"Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?"
20499,Dwight,I got it. I got it.
20500,Andy," Hey, do you need a lozenge?"
20501,Darryl, They're a bunch of jackals.
20502,Darryl,"They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home."
20503,Andy,: Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
20504,Andy,"Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back.  Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?"
20505,Dwight, You're gonna blow it.
20506,Oscar,We got it! Wow! We got it!
20507,Pam,"Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself."
20508,Oscar,"Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes."
20509,Oscar," Ah. No!  . Although I must say, I will have ""apoplexy"" if you lose. Do you understand? ""Apoplexy"" is what I will have."
20510,Erin,"Got it.  Oh, Oscar. Oscar?"
20511,Jim, I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
20512,Andy,"Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so..."
20513,Michael," Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you.   All, you have to close right now."
20514,Andy,"Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it."
20515,Michael,"No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it."
20516,Michael,"Andy, what's the problem?"
20517,Andy,This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
20518,Michael,"You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.   What is taking that guy so long?"
20519,Jim,Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
20520,Pam,I don't know. They're still in there.
20521,Pam,Stop. Out with it.
20522,Pam,"Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom."
20523,Jim,"Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually."
20524,Pam,"And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group."
20525,Jim,"I was blue group, so it was second from the top."
20526,Jim,Was in the green group.
20527,Pam,"And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence."
20528,Jim,And that's what I told him.
20529,Pam,Right. But how'd you say it?
20530,Jim,"""My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with."""
20531,Andy,"Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?"
20532,Andy,"Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else?  Sold! Anybody else?  Yes! All right!"
20533,Andy,Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
20534,Andy,"But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime."
20535,Jim,"Yeah, woah.  Yep, absolutely, go ahead."
20536,Jim,"It has been, yeah."
20537,Jim,"Oh, man. You remember that, huh?"
20538,Jim,"All right, good catch-up."
20539,Dwight,Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
20540,Andy,"Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em."
20541,Michael," Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on."
20542,Michael,What? Come on. It's time for grapes.  Real fun day.
20543,Erin,I know. You get to pick.
20544,Andy,"Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it."
20545,Erin,"There's a ""Shrek"" two?!"
20546,Andy,"Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow."
20547,Ryan,"Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides."
20548,Pam,Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
20549,Ryan,It's not irrelevant. Details
20550,Andy,"Sorry, when did you get married?"
20551,Andy,And you didn't invite any of us?
20552,Ryan,"We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time."
20553,Ryan,"No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married."
20554,Oscar,"You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married."
20555,Ryan,"No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!"
20556,Ryan,"Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?"
20557,Michael,Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
20558,Michael,You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
20559,Michael,"I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?"
20560,Michael,Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
20561,Michael,"Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree."
20562,Michael,I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
20563,Jim,He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
20564,Pam,"Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny ""Jim"" game."
20565,Jim,That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
20566,Pam,"All right, what'd you do?"
20567,Jim,"Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art."
20568,Pam,Where'd you put it?
20569,Jim,Where'd I put what?
20570,Jim,"Oh, sorry gotta go."
20571,Jim,"Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer."
20572,Jim,"Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance."
20573,Pam,"The fridge, got it."
20574,Jim,And the final clue...
20575,Jim,"You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine."
20576,Erin,Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
20577,Jim,Cheer up. We made a sale.
20578,Michael,Just drive faster. I want to get back.
20579,Jim,"Well, I'm going the speed limit. So..."
20580,Michael,"Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit."
20581,Jim,Someone's in a bad mood.
20582,Michael,"No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?"
20583,Jim,"Alright, let me turn on some music."
20584,Michael,I need to pee.
20585,Michael,"Yeah, I do. My word against yours."
20586,Jim,Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
20587,Michael,"What part of ""I need to pee"" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car."
20588,Jim,"Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over."
20589,Michael,Well I hope I make it.
20590,Jim,Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
20591,Jim,"Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?"
20592,Jim,"Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok."
20593,Jim,Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
20594,Jim,"Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car."
20595,Jim,"No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra."
20596,Jim,"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet."
20597,Jim,And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
20598,Pam,"Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a ""Ask Pam Beasley"". ... Did the phone cut off?"
20599,Pam,"Alright, just call me after the doctor."
20600,Michael,"I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted."
20601,Michael,There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
20602,Michael,"Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?"
20603,Michael,"You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number."
20604,Michael,"Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok."
20605,Erin,You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
20606,Erin,It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
20607,Dwight,"Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat."
20608,Pam,"Cute.  Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good."
20609,Oscar,Which on in particular?
20610,Pam,"Well the first one has a surprise factor. ""I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"""
20611,Pam,"But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line."
20612,Oscar,"""I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again."""
20613,Pam,"You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging."
20614,Darryl,And I will take you all down.
20615,Darryl,I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me.
20616,Andy,Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
20617,Pam,"Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes."
20618,Dwight,Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
20619,Erin,He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
20620,Dwight,"Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way."
20621,Dwight,Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  Let's ride.
20622,Michael, Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute.  Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess.  You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk.  Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  I'm being serious. Seriously.
20623,Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam."
20624,Dwight,Has Michael checked in?
20625,Dwight,I asked you a question.
20626,Pam,"No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought..."
20627,Dwight,"Pam, this isn't a shopping trip."
20628,Dwight,This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
20629,Pam,"Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out..."
20630,Dwight,"Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up."
20631,Pam,"Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... "
20632,Dwight,No word from Michael.
20633,Kevin,"Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island."
20634,Oscar,Ok. I got one.
20635,Darryl,"Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game."
20636,Oscar,Irony is such a critical...
20637,Darryl,"Wrap it up, Gabe."
20638,Oscar,"Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM."
20639,Darryl,Send me one too.
20640,Andy,"Yeah, yeah. Put me on that."
20641,Michael,"Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog."
20642,Michael,Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
20643,Michael,With that I can buy... half the menu.
20644,Michael,All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
20645,Michael,"Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?"
20646,Michael,Okay. You've just lost my business.
20647,Erin,"Hey, you were in there forever."
20648,Dwight,There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
20649,Erin,She wandered off like an idiot.
20650,Dwight,What are you doing?
20651,Erin,Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
20652,Dwight,"Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?"
20653,Michael,"Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?"
20654,Michael,Okay. I'll be right back. . Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
20655,Michael,"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing."
20656,Michael,Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
20657,Michael,I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
20658,Michael,"Well, I think I can get through the door."
20659,Dwight,"Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian..."
20660,Dwight,"Uncanny. Put a pin in that.  Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him.  This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?"
20661,Darryl,"You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people.  "
20662,Andy,Do the next one.
20663,Darryl,Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
20664,Pam,"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner."
20665,Oscar,Who's is it? Who wrote that?
20666,Angela,Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
20667,Erin,"Where did he go, Holly?"
20668,Dwight,"Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, ""this way, this way""?"
20669,Dwight,"Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!"
20670,Dwight,All right then. Someone propose a plan.
20671,Erin,Okay. We fan out...
20672,Dwight,That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
20673,Erin,Good. We don't need her.
20674,Dwight,"Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling."
20675,Michael,Hi.  How did you know I was up here?
20676,Michael,I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
20677,Michael,Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much.
20678,Michael,Can I kiss you?
20679,Pam,Hey. How you doing?
20680,Darryl,Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
20681,Darryl,She was about to turn 97.
20682,Pam,"At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you."
20683,Darryl,"Thank you. ""Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted."" ""Have fun today, big guy."" ""Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop."""
20684,Pam,It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
20685,Darryl,"""Hooray. Live it up big D. "" ""Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this""?"
20686,Andy,Birthday punches!  One two three four five sice seven eight!
20687,Andy,...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
20688,Andy,...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
20689,Darryl,Rachel from the party?
20690,Darryl,Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! 
20691,Michael,Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
20692,Michael,"Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye."
20693,Michael,Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
20694,Michael,"Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it.  It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you."
20695,Erin,From my secret admirer. That's you!
20696,Erin,"""Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue."" Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!"
20697,Erin,"But, there's no clue."
20698,Erin,"I can't, 'cause there's no clue."
20699,Michael, Are these numbers correct?
20700,Oscar,"The numbers are correct, Michael."
20701,Michael,"Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out."
20702,Oscar,I jus... I just need a signature.
20703,Jim, There you go. Thanks.
20704,Pam,How much did you give him?
20705,Pam,Wait. I don't have my scarf.
20706,Pam,I'm missing my scarf. Oh. 
20707,Jim,We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
20708,Pam," Yeah, lunch was wonderful!"
20709,Pam,"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?"
20710,Pam,"Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?"
20711,Erin,Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
20712,Andy,Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
20713,Andy,"But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably..."
20714,Erin,"Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends."
20715,Andy,At least until Stanley calms down.
20716,Andy,D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. 
20717,Jim," All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. "
20718,Dwight,"Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. "
20719,Dwight,You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
20720,Angela,"I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA."
20721,Oscar,Yes! The freaking PDA!
20722,Oscar,"Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them."
20723,Angela,No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
20724,Angela,...but it's totally inappropriate.
20725,Darryl,"Yeah, it's a little much."
20726,Darryl,"Obviously, so happy for them both."
20727,Kevin,"I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because..."
20728,Angela,"No, stop! Just don't."
20729,Kevin,Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
20730,Erin,So tell me about your new girlfriend.
20731,Andy,"She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there."
20732,Andy,"Hey, look at that. Done."
20733,Erin,That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
20734,Andy,I wish you well on your quest.
20735,Michael,"Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. "
20736,Michael," Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?"
20737,Michael,Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
20738,Ryan,"Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting."
20739,Jim,Love it. Keep it goin.
20740,Oscar,Are you guys listening to this?
20741,Michael,"What, are you talking about me and Holly?"
20742,Oscar,Not occasionally. All the time.
20743,Michael,Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
20744,Darryl,That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
20745,Michael,"I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it."
20746,Dwight,Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
20747,Dwight,I've had intercourse in the office.
20748,Dwight,As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed.  As has Michael and as has Holly.
20749,Kevin,She goes to another school.
20750,Michael,Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
20751,Michael,You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
20752,Oscar,Just leave it how you said...
20753,Dwight,"Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?"
20754,Michael,"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?"
20755,Dwight,And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
20756,Michael,"No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises."
20757,Pam,"That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have s*x in the office. That's where you work, right?"
20758,Pam,"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had s*x there, except for you and him."
20759,Erin,Don't mind us. You keep working.
20760,Darryl,Okay. I'll keep working.
20761,Erin,"Oh, my God. It's a song."
20762,Erin,What do you think is on it?
20763,Andy, We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
20764,Erin, Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
20765,Andy,I think he can hear us.
20766,Andy," That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level."
20767,Andy,Darryl is a jerk.
20768,Andy,"No, I'm just testing if he can hear."
20769,Darryl,I can hear you.
20770,Erin,Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
20771,Andy,The temp at night?
20772,Darryl,You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
20773,Darryl,Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
20774,Michael,"Ah, the old ""leave behind."" Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working."
20775,Michael,"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt."
20776,Michael,"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop."
20777,Michael,Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
20778,Michael,"Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day."
20779,Michael,I love you-love you.
20780,Michael,I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. 
20781,Michael,"Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me."
20782,Andy,"Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?"
20783,Erin,I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
20784,Andy,"Oh, or maybe not. "
20785,Andy,How romantic is this?
20786,Andy,Right. Do you see a clue or...
20787,Erin,Yeah. Did you not see it? 
20788,Andy,No time to chat.
20789,Jim,"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here."
20790,Ryan,Hey. You're looking for me?
20791,Pam,"Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey."
20792,Ryan,You wanted to have s*x in my office.
20793,Jim,Definitely not. That's disgusting.
20794,Ryan,No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
20795,Jim,"Hey, you don't have to..."
20796,Pam,That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.
20797,Jim,That was really rough.
20798,Pam,Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have s*x in the office.
20799,Jim,"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place."
20800,Pam,"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed."
20801,Michael,"No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you."
20802,Michael,"Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh."
20803,Michael,I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
20804,Oscar,"Okay, this is much worse than before."
20805,Kevin,"Yeah, I agree. This is nasty."
20806,Michael,I will grab you here anyway. 
20807,Michael,"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained."
20808,Michael,"Yes, it was that. It's that one."
20809,Michael,We're not supposed to PDA.
20810,Michael,I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
20811,Michael,That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
20812,Michael,I was in love with you.
20813,Erin,"Oh. One Erin Special, please."
20814,Kevin," Hey, buck up, buddy!"
20815,Darryl,Make that face he likes.
20816,Dwight,Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
20817,Michael,It's like a time bomb...
20818,Michael,"...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging."
20819,Michael, Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
20820,Michael,No.  Saving the world has never been this hard.
20821,Dwight,Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
20822,Michael,"No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending."
20823,Dwight,Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
20824,Kevin,Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
20825,Michael,Do the monkey face.
20826,Dwight,Do the monkey face!
20827,Michael,I love that. I love that face.
20828,Dwight,Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
20829,Dwight,Go back to the monkey!
20830,Michael,Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
20831,Michael,That's good. He's throwing it.
20832,Dwight,They really do that.
20833,Erin,Like a benign tumor.
20834,Andy,"Maybe it's just more like, ""be mine."""
20835,Erin,"Oh, yes. There's a note. ""A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss."""
20836,Erin,Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm 
20837,Michael,"Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up."
20838,Michael,"Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
20839,Michael,"You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's..."
20840,Michael,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay!  Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!"
20841,Oscar,Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
20842,Kevin,"Better luck next time, pal."
20843,Michael,"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu."
20844,Oscar,Go on. Kiss each other already. 
20845,Kevin,"Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you."
20846,Oscar,I just told them to do it!
20847,Jim,No. We took a walk.
20848,Pam,We took a walk.
20849,Dwight,"My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago."
20850,Ryan,Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
20851,Kevin,"Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with."
20852,Michael,What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
20853,Michael,Leave it at reception.
20854,Michael, Clean up on aisle five. : Midnight titlescreen appears]
20855,Michael,"After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight."
20856,Michael,Erin... what are you doing?
20857,Erin,"Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it."
20858,Michael,"That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth."
20859,Jim,Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
20860,Pam,"We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie."
20861,Jim,"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!"
20862,Pam,"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy.  Everything pointed to it being a comedy."
20863,Pam,We'd love to see it!
20864,Michael,"Sweet, I will go invite Holly."
20865,Pam,"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?"
20866,Michael,"Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom."
20867,Michael,It's got a lot of me.
20868,Michael,"Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. "
20869,Dwight,"I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice-  to be like this!  But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person."
20870,Michael,Dwight does not play a robot.
20871,Michael,Tell him I'm retired.
20872,Michael,"Goldenface, this makes it personal."
20873,Michael," Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven.  Heads.  Tails. ...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails.  Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five."
20874,Jim,I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
20875,Michael,"I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey."
20876,Michael,What am I supposed to do with this?
20877,Michael," Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me."
20878,Oscar,"Hey, you came in second. Not bad either."
20879,Michael,I am sorry that I have to do this... 
20880,Michael,I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
20881,Michael,"Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town. "
20882,Dwight,He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
20883,Michael,"By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story."
20884,Michael,"The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist."
20885,Michael,"He said, where is the bomb?"
20886,Michael,Why are you telling me this?
20887,Michael,That was not scripted.
20888,Pam,"Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God...  So good."
20889,Michael,"It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn."
20890,Michael,For the insurance money! I knew it all along!  You will never get away with this! 
20891,Michael,I got problems Billy. Big problems...
20892,Michael, Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
20893,Michael,"No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died."
20894,Michael," Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way.  You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!  You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!"
20895,Jim,"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back."
20896,Kevin,It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
20897,Ryan,You should enter it in festivals!
20898,Michael," Well that's a... pretty good reaction.  Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?"
20899,Michael,"Okay.  No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough..."
20900,Andy,Some people are really popping on screen!
20901,Michael,"Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!"
20902,Michael,Did you? What did you love about it?
20903,Michael,"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly."
20904,Michael,"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded."
20905,Michael," It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream."
20906,Michael,"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus."
20907,Michael,"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing."
20908,Michael,"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie."
20909,Michael,"Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you."
20910,Michael,"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans."
20911,Michael,Who likes Threat Level: Midnight?  Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! 
20912,Michael,"I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!"
20913,Michael, This one's for you Cherokee Jack. 
20914,Michael,"We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states."
20915,Jim," That's fine, it's great!"
20916,Michael,"No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. "
20917,Pam,I'm just making conversation.
20918,Michael,"No it's not.  It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it."
20919,Michael,"Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot."
20920,Andy, Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
20921,Michael,Oh yeah!  Yes he is!
20922,Dwight,"No no, he's doing it to catch the president!"
20923,Michael,"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. "
20924,Dwight,I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
20925,Kevin,You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
20926,Dwight,They're still good for another week.
20927,Kevin,I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. 
20928,Dwight,"Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?"
20929,Jim,"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging."
20930,Dwight,"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months."
20931,Dwight,"I can see that happening, yes."
20932,Dwight,That's a realistic time line.
20933,Jim,Okay now really think hard about this one: One year.
20934,Dwight,I can see that as a very real possibility.
20935,Jim, Four hundred and ninety-four months?
20936,Dwight,I can see that happening.
20937,Jim,Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
20938,Michael,Still not seeing the problem here.
20939,Michael,"It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly."
20940,Michael,"Oh, Michael! This'll be just us."
20941,Michael,"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots."
20942,Michael,And it also helps if you've had five shots.
20943,Jim, Why is Packer back?
20944,Dwight,Why's he talking to Holly?
20945,Michael," Don't know, don't care."
20946,Michael," Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms."
20947,Kevin,Nice! We got burned!
20948,Michael,"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out."
20949,Dwight," Holly, you approved this?"
20950,Jim,You did approve it?
20951,Kevin,What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
20952,Kevin,I have very little patience for stupidity.
20953,Erin, Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
20954,Erin,"Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there.  Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!"
20955,Pam,"I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one!  Right?"
20956,Pam,"Awwh, you're welcome.  My pleasure."
20957,Jim, Can I do something for ya?
20958,Pam,I just helped someone out. It feels good.
20959,Jim,"Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so..."
20960,Pam,So you know the feeling.
20961,Michael,Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
20962,Dwight,I didn't order anything.
20963,Michael,And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
20964,Dwight,Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
20965,Michael,"So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. "
20966,Dwight,"I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael."
20967,Dwight,No it is not.
20968,Michael, Let's look at this.
20969,Dwight,I don't wanna move desks!
20970,Michael,Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom!
20971,Jim,Do I have any say in this?!
20972,Dwight," Hey, who's dirt box is this?"
20973,Dwight,"What do you grow in here, bullcrap? "
20974,Jim,"Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?"
20975,Jim, Why are you nodding?
20976,Ryan,Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
20977,Jim,"Well, I mean he humped Michael."
20978,Andy," Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around!  Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach.  They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh.  This computer's a hunk of jjunk."
20979,Erin,Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! 
20980,Andy,Where did you get this?!
20981,Erin,Pam gave it to me!
20982,Andy,"This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer!  Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?"
20983,Pam,You have a computer Andy.
20984,Andy,"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So..."
20985,Pam,"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one."
20986,Andy,"Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but..."
20987,Pam,"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy."
20988,Andy,"I'm not asking for one, I need it."
20989,Andy,"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out."
20990,Pam,"See, this is what I'm talking about."
20991,Andy,What are you gonna play mange on faster?
20992,Kevin,"Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!"
20993,Kevin,I do know how to read though!
20994,Kevin," He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight."
20995,Dwight,"Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer."
20996,Pam, What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
20997,Andy,"It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched."
20998,Pam,What? Erin is that true?
20999,Erin," I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one."
21000,Pam,"Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away."
21001,Andy,"Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-"
21002,Pam,"I'm not freaking out, Andy."
21003,Pam,"Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?"
21004,Andy,That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
21005,Pam,Switch the computers back Andy.
21006,Andy,Fine!  Please make sure no one is humping me!
21007,Erin," Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon.  Thanks."
21008,Michael,Best day ever. Best day ever!
21009,Michael,"Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?"
21010,Michael,"Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell."
21011,Michael,"No. Not me, him."
21012,Erin, If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
21013,Michael,"Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey..."
21014,Michael,He's funnier than me.
21015,Michael,So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
21016,Erin, Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
21017,Erin, For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! 
21018,Dwight," Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate."
21019,Dwight,'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
21020,Jim,That's a lot of reasons! 
21021,Jim, Can I talk to you a second?
21022,Jim,"So, this hot chocolate thing."
21023,Dwight,None of your business.
21024,Jim,"Well, you know you can't actually poison him."
21025,Dwight,"It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this."
21026,Jim,I really think we should join forces on this one.
21027,Jim,"What do we think, what would drive him crazy."
21028,Dwight,"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate."
21029,Jim,"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them."
21030,Dwight, Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
21031,Jim,"Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number."
21032,Dwight,Who is Justice Beaver?
21033,Jim,He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
21034,Dwight,Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
21035,Jim,"Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred."
21036,Dwight,"Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over."
21037,Andy,Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
21038,Pam,I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
21039,Andy,Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
21040,Andy,Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
21041,Pam,Okay.  When did people sign-
21042,Andy,"Mind if I close the door?  What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool."
21043,Pam,"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?"
21044,Andy,You humiliated me in front of every body!
21045,Pam,"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks."
21046,Andy,"I mean, it's pretty broken already."
21047,Pam,"Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one."
21048,Ryan," Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. "
21049,Dwight, There are over four hundred of these! 
21050,Jim,Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
21051,Dwight,"They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-"
21052,Jim,One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
21053,Dwight,"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.  Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going."
21054,Andy, Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not?  Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer.  Why are you doing this to me Andy?  Because I hate your programs!
21055,Michael,"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. "
21056,Michael,"I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin."
21057,Michael,I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
21058,Michael,"You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls."
21059,Michael,"Yeah, a little bit."
21060,Michael," Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here."
21061,Kevin,I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
21062,Michael,"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed."
21063,Kevin,"That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it."
21064,Michael,"Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines."
21065,Kevin,"Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show."
21066,Michael,"Kevin, do you accept the apology?"
21067,Michael,"Okay, go back to the annex."
21068,Ryan, Sometimes you over react.
21069,Oscar,"Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one."
21070,Michael,"That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-"
21071,Michael,"I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!"
21072,Pam," So listen, we have to really scuff this up."
21073,Andy,"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry."
21074,Pam,"Andy, this is the deal we made."
21075,Andy, That's probably good. That's enough.
21076,Pam,We should break this hinge maybe.
21077,Andy,Let's not go crazy.
21078,Jim," Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. "
21079,Jim,"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!"
21080,Dwight, And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
21081,Jim, Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
21082,Dwight,Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
21083,Dwight,Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
21084,Michael,What are you doing?
21085,Jim," All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! "
21086,Michael,"I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?"
21087,Dwight,He took my desk.
21088,Michael,"Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?"
21089,Dwight,"It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas."
21090,Michael,You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
21091,Dwight,"No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing."
21092,Michael,"He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him."
21093,Jim,Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? 
21094,Andy," Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?"
21095,Pam,Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
21096,Andy,"Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?"
21097,Pam,"Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. "
21098,Andy,"All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. "
21099,Michael,Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
21100,Michael,"No, nothing like that at all."
21101,Michael,That is.  It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
21102,Michael,"Nah, he's an ass."
21103,Pam," Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there."
21104,Pam,I'm full on corrupt!
21105,Pam,"Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?"
21106,Oscar,No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
21107,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves."
21108,Dwight,People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
21109,Pam,It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
21110,Dwight,It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
21111,Pam,The signs will drive people inside.
21112,Dwight,The warmth will lure people inside.
21113,Dwight,This is how business...
21114,Dwight,I'm not closing the door.
21115,Dwight,"Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?"
21116,Dwight,"Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here."
21117,Dwight,I will trade you for the used candle.
21118,Dwight,"Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this."
21119,Dwight,That's how it's done.
21120,Kevin,"Woah, I love her. How much for that?"
21121,Michael,I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
21122,Michael,"Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that."
21123,Michael,That is how you do it.
21124,Michael,You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
21125,Michael,In case... in case of what?
21126,Michael,I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
21127,Michael," Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you."
21128,Dwight,"Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies."
21129,Dwight,People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
21130,Dwight,And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
21131,Andy,"Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?"
21132,Kevin,Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
21133,Kevin,Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
21134,Darryl,We should play it.
21135,Andy,Well... there's no instructions.
21136,Darryl,"It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out."
21137,Andy,I'm pretty good at board games.
21138,Darryl,"Well, shall we make it a little interesting?"
21139,Jim,How did those get out? I'm sorry.
21140,Dwight,Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
21141,Jim,"I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known."
21142,Dwight,That's a common swindlers trick.
21143,Jim,"Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone."
21144,Dwight,So you wanna sell me magic beans. 
21145,Jim,Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
21146,Dwight,Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
21147,Pam,"Oh, which one is decaf?"
21148,Pam,Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
21149,Michael,"Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas."
21150,Pam,Why do you need more gas?
21151,Michael,"Well, I'm writing a message."
21152,Pam,Is it a good message or a bad message?
21153,Michael,I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
21154,Michael,Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
21155,Pam,Yea. Yea no problem. 
21156,Pam,"Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible."
21157,Michael,I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
21158,Michael,"No, this is romantic."
21159,Pam,You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
21160,Ryan,"My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted."
21161,Dwight,You got this kosher certified?
21162,Ryan,"No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good."
21163,Dwight,"Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. "
21164,Ryan,Thank you. Whatcha got there?
21165,Dwight,"Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco."
21166,Dwight,things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
21167,Dwight,"Jim, put those away."
21168,Jim, I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
21169,Dwight,"just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?"
21170,Jim,"They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. "
21171,Pam,Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
21172,Pam,You called the meeting I don't..
21173,Michael,Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
21174,Pam,We are a family.
21175,Michael,I could not have agreed with you more.
21176,Pam,"And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way."
21177,Pam,So about this proposal thing...
21178,Michael,"No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it."
21179,Pam,"Michael, she's perfect for you."
21180,Jim,She's amazing. This is very exciting.
21181,Pam,So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
21182,Michael,I had a great idea until you ruined it.
21183,Oscar,"Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself."
21184,Andy," Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card ."
21185,Andy,And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
21186,Kevin,No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
21187,Andy,Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
21188,Darryl,And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
21189,Darryl,Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
21190,Kevin,no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
21191,Darryl,It was in the box.
21192,Andy,We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
21193,Kevin,No but that's not fair.
21194,Oscar,"What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? "
21195,Ryan,My mom also makes the best salsa.
21196,Pam,Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
21197,Ryan,Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
21198,Michael,"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'"
21199,Michael,"It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring."
21200,Jim,Don't think you need the corpse then.
21201,Pam,Holy s*** is that real?
21202,Michael,Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
21203,Michael,Is she not going to like that?
21204,Pam,No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
21205,Jim,At a gas station. 
21206,Michael,At a gas station?
21207,Jim,Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
21208,Michael,That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
21209,Pam,No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
21210,Michael,Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
21211,Michael,I just... it's terrifying.
21212,Pam,She's not gonna say no.
21213,Michael,I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
21214,Jim,Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
21215,Michael,Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
21216,Michael,"Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything."
21217,Michael,Oh ok. For how long?
21218,Michael,"Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that."
21219,Michael,"No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope."
21220,Michael,No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
21221,Kevin,Hey guys it's my turn.
21222,Andy,"You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago."
21223,Kevin,"Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people."
21224,Darryl,"I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses."
21225,Kevin,This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
21226,Darryl,Yeah where is it?
21227,Kevin,Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
21228,Kevin,And that is Dallas. 
21229,Ryan,Can't really tell the...
21230,Dwight,I know right... what the?
21231,Jim,"It is right. I mean, it's impossible."
21232,Dwight,"All right, I'll take them."
21233,Dwight,"I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope."
21234,Michael,"Hey, how'd we do?"
21235,Michael,That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
21236,Michael,"No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that."
21237,Michael,Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
21238,Michael,So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
21239,Michael,This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
21240,Michael,This is where we first kissed.
21241,Michael,And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
21242,Michael,"Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes."
21243,Michael,"Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?"
21244,Michael,We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
21245,Michael,"And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong."
21246,Michael,"Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. "
21247,Michael,Let's go in here.
21248,Michael,"This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives."
21249,Jim,"Holly, will you marry me?"
21250,Michael,That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
21251,Oscar,Will you marry me?
21252,Michael,That marriage would be a sham.
21253,Angela,Will you marry me?
21254,Michael,That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
21255,Ryan,Will you marry me Holly?
21256,Michael,Only one that I was kind of worried about.
21257,Michael," This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with..  Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?"
21258,Michael,"Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado."
21259,Michael,Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
21260,Michael,"Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years."
21261,Michael,"And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms."
21262,Michael,Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
21263,Michael,"I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado."
21264,Michael,Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
21265,Michael,"No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo."
21266,Michael,"You know, I would like to try the luge, through."
21267,Michael,That's what I've heard.
21268,Michael,Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
21269,Michael,Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
21270,Michael,"Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. "
21271,Michael,"No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar."
21272,Michael,You are? What bar?
21273,Michael,I... do not see you.
21274,Michael,"I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour."
21275,Michael,Are we both at the right place?
21276,Michael,I hear your voice.
21277,Michael,"I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott."
21278,Michael,Wow... that is insane! 
21279,Michael, Here we go! Are you ready?
21280,Michael,Alright! Here we go!
21281,Michael,This is it. What do you think?
21282,Oscar,Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
21283,Kevin," Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! "
21284,Michael,"Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!"
21285,Michael,"I am well, sir, how are you?"
21286,Dwight,Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
21287,Michael,"And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!"
21288,Angela,"Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid."
21289,Michael,"I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!"
21290,Michael,Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
21291,Andy,That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these.  nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
21292,Andy,"I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted."
21293,Michael,"This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes."
21294,Pam,"Well, it wasn't an affair."
21295,Pam,"But, no, but we are a family."
21296,Pam,"Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. "
21297,Pam,Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
21298,Jim,"Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies."
21299,Dwight,Thanks for meeting me.
21300,Michael,Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
21301,Dwight,"There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here."
21302,Michael,"You know me very well, Dwight."
21303,Dwight,"That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy."
21304,Michael,Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
21305,Dwight,"I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me."
21306,Michael,So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
21307,Darryl,It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
21308,Darryl,"It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good."
21309,Darryl,I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
21310,Kevin,"Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them."
21311,Angela,"Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?"
21312,Angela,"Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know."
21313,Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you."
21314,Erin,"Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend."
21315,Erin,"Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!"
21316,Michael,I sorta like the old way.
21317,Michael,"I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-"
21318,Michael,"Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work."
21319,Erin,What do you think?
21320,Michael,You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. 
21321,Erin, ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. 
21322,Andy,Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... 
21323,Erin,"Deangelo, did you order a barber?"
21324,Darryl,"Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?"
21325,Andy,I... don't know. Help me.
21326,Ryan, That is so badass. So hardcore.
21327,Michael, Shave me.  This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
21328,Michael,And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. 
21329,Michael,"It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice."
21330,Oscar,You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
21331,Michael,"Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-"
21332,Pam,"Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable."
21333,Jim,"Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'."
21334,Jim,And what happens here is-
21335,Jim,We were... I think she was just trying to-
21336,Michael,"You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something."
21337,Oscar,"Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent."
21338,Michael,"Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about."
21339,Erin,"Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips."
21340,Michael,Don't shave my lips.
21341,Andy,"I don't mean to go into a rant here, but..."
21342,Andy,"I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny."
21343,Andy,"...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock."
21344,Andy, I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- 
21345,Andy,"Yeah, right, I mean- "
21346,Erin," Deangelo, this box came for you."
21347,Michael,"You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-"
21348,Michael,"I still have to look at this stuff, guys."
21349,Darryl,"So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?"
21350,Michael,"Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy."
21351,Darryl,"Cool, cool. Alright, see you later."
21352,Darryl,"No, I'm good. Keep them."
21353,Andy, Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... 
21354,Andy,I guess this is my life now.
21355,Dwight,How do I become a manger at Sabre?
21356,Dwight,I left a message at corporate.
21357,Dwight,Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
21358,Dwight,From when he recommended me to replace him.
21359,Michael, Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
21360,Michael,"PB and J, my mom's recipe! "
21361,Angela,Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
21362,Michael,"I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! "
21363,Oscar,"Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?"
21364,Jim,"Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?"
21365,Michael,"Oscar, here you go. "
21366,Michael,No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
21367,Michael,"No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are."
21368,Oscar,"Michael, This is insane."
21369,Michael,"No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No."
21370,Jim,"Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this."
21371,Michael,"Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight."
21372,Dwight,"Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room."
21373,Michael,"I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine."
21374,Michael,Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
21375,Michael,"No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it."
21376,Michael,You'll figure it out.
21377,Jim,"Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?"
21378,Jim,Thank you very much.
21379,Pam,"See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand."
21380,Jim,We're back in! Right?
21381,Michael,It is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
21382,Michael,"Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. "
21383,Michael,Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
21384,Michael," Alright let's go!  This way, this way! "
21385,Michael,You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
21386,Michael, Here we go! Have Pam come down.
21387,Jim,No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
21388,Michael, Hey Toby! You suck! 
21389,Michael, Go go go go go go!
21390,Michael, I've never seen this place in the daylight.
21391,Michael,"Here we go, alright got it? Set?  Hello? "
21392,Michael,Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
21393,Erin,"Oh hey, didn't see you."
21394,Michael,You have big plans for tonight?
21395,Erin,"I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! "
21396,Michael,You are getting so funny!  Very good.
21397,Michael,"The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on."
21398,Michael,Anything can happen at the Dundies!  They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
21399,Dwight,"Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair."
21400,Dwight,Every day is black tie optional!
21401,Michael,"A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!"
21402,Pam,"Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!"
21403,Ryan,I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
21404,Pam,"Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?"
21405,Ryan,"I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking."
21406,Pam,"You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. "
21407,Michael,"Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?"
21408,Michael,"So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.  And that person is  DeAngelo! "
21409,Dwight,"Always the padawan, never the Jedi."
21410,Michael,Think of it as part of your training.
21411,Michael," Okay, well we'll work on it."
21412,Michael,You are doing it.
21413,Michael, Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
21414,Kevin,Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
21415,Michael,"Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning."
21416,Michael," Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys..."
21417,Michael,Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
21418,Ryan,"Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough."
21419,Michael, There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
21420,Jim,Having a great time.
21421,Andy,Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
21422,Michael,"No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!"
21423,Jim,"Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting."
21424,Michael,"Jim, please no loopholes."
21425,Darryl,"Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?"
21426,Michael,"This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?"
21427,Michael,"Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood."
21428,Michael," Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it.  Let's try this. Put these on.  I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't-  That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this,  and make it sound perfect."
21429,Michael,Say it with an accent!
21430,Jim," I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries."
21431,Pam,"Yeah...  Hey, Erin, everything okay?"
21432,Erin,"Get away from the car, he's gonna see you."
21433,Jim,Who's gonna see us?
21434,Erin, Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
21435,Jim,Get in the car? 
21436,Erin,Please! Sorry. Get in.  Sorry sorry sorry.
21437,Erin,I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
21438,Pam,Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
21439,Erin,"I, really don't like spending time with him."
21440,Pam,"Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?"
21441,Jim,I think I'm gonna go.
21442,Jim,I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better!
21443,Jim,"I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me."
21444,Erin,"I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean."
21445,Pam,"Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. "
21446,Dwight,Appalling.  Eye sore.  Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
21447,Erin,"DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you."
21448,Angela,"Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!"
21449,Oscar,"Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help."
21450,Michael,I'm here.  In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
21451,Oscar,"The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content."
21452,Dwight,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott.  Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers!  Was that part of the...?"
21453,Michael," DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!"
21454,Michael,"No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!"
21455,Michael,"Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!"
21456,Michael," You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there."
21457,Michael,"You can do it, just say it."
21458,Michael,"Now hit me.  One, two, three."
21459,Michael,"Alright, here we go."
21460,Michael,Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. 
21461,Jim,"Nope, go back to the script."
21462,Michael,"There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! "
21463,Jim,"Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?"
21464,Jim,"I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!"
21465,Pam,You didn't think to mention me huh?
21466,Michael,"Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!"
21467,Dwight,"Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?"
21468,Jim,I gotta go do this.
21469,Dwight,Big smiles folks! There they are.
21470,Michael,"Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny Cordray!  Danny couldn't be here tonight..."
21471,Ryan,"How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective."
21472,Michael,"Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.  But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson!  Come on up here you sick b*st*rd."
21473,Kevin,I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
21474,Michael,"You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?  Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! "
21475,Erin,"Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life.  People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up."
21476,Erin,"I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam?  Thank you for hearing me."
21477,Darryl,Damn that was cold.
21478,Michael,"It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. "
21479,Michael, DeAngelo is expressing himself.
21480,Michael,"Okay, we're done! That's it."
21481,Michael,We're done. We're done!
21482,Michael," So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well..."
21483,Pam,"Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!"
21484,Michael,"No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time."
21485,Pam,"Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. "
21486,Michael,"So what you're saying is you kinda like it?  I've fallen and I can't get up!  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good."
21487,Jim,"I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-"
21488,Michael,That got a big laugh.
21489,Jim,That did. Pretty huge laugh.
21490,Michael, You were laughing right?
21491,Dwight,We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
21492,Michael,"That's true, we wouldn't get seats together."
21493,Michael," You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well."
21494,Dwight,I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
21495,Michael,Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
21496,Dwight,"Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!"
21497,Michael,What is your problem?!
21498,Dwight,"I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring."
21499,Michael,"Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful."
21500,Dwight,"And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!"
21501,Michael,He is in an all-out sprint.
21502,Michael," Here...  Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! "
21503,Andy,"A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael."
21504,Andy,"I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything."
21505,Michael,"Oh my God, something's happening."
21506,Andy," Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math."
21507,Ryan,You helped me get off drugs!
21508,Oscar,I forgive you for kissing me!
21509,Michael," Yeah, okay.  Well this is gonna hurt like a mother."
21510,Oscar, It's his last Dundies.
21511,Jim,You gotta play along man.
21512,Michael,Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! 
21513,Michael," Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude."
21514,Dwight,I've got a treat for you!
21515,Michael,"Ahh, thank you. Like a butler."
21516,Dwight,"Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters."
21517,Michael," Oh, these do not taste like oysters."
21518,Dwight," That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning!  Hah!"
21519,Michael,Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
21520,Dwight,What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
21521,Michael,"I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay?  The job was not mine to give.  Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies."
21522,Dwight,Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
21523,Michael,"Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket..."
21524,Michael,...in order to feed the bears.
21525,Dwight,Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
21526,Michael,How do you mean?
21527,Dwight,"Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand?  You're like a giant walking salami!"
21528,Michael,"Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?"
21529,Dwight,Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
21530,Michael,Well I have interviews.
21531,Michael,"Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure."
21532,Michael,"Oh you don't, that's-"
21533,Michael,That sounds good. Thank you.
21534,Michael,"Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck."
21535,Andy,"Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?"
21536,Andy,Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
21537,Jim,So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
21538,Pam,What's wrong with cupcakes?
21539,Michael, There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
21540,Pam,Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
21541,Pam,So this is the dream team.
21542,Angela,The dream team... and Meredith.
21543,Michael,"You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla."
21544,Michael,"Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?"
21545,Pam,Should we get toppings?
21546,Michael,What do you like Pam?
21547,Michael,What kind of toppings would you like?
21548,Michael,Sounds good. Fudge it up! 
21549,Michael," I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this.  I still need something to drink out of though."
21550,Michael," Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis."
21551,Michael,"When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.  And she still is."
21552,Michael," Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well!  And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. "
21553,Michael,"Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt.  May you never lose the fun loving quality in life."
21554,Michael,"Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. "
21555,Andy,You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
21556,Michael,"But you're the best salesman, on the inside."
21557,Michael,"You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted."
21558,Andy,I'm gonna lose 'em.
21559,Michael,You're not gonna lose them.
21560,Andy,I promise you that I will.
21561,Michael,Just do your best! I have faith in you.
21562,Dwight,I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
21563,Michael,"Kevin, I have something for you."
21564,Michael,You know who that is?
21565,Michael," Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?"
21566,Michael,"Good, stand up.  You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore."
21567,Michael,You will find love.
21568,Kevin,"Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now."
21569,Michael,"Don't be. You should never settle for who you are.  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-"
21570,Andy,"I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!"
21571,Michael," Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. "
21572,Oscar,Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
21573,Michael," It looks like a  It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it!  He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!"
21574,Michael,"Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have s*x at some point?"
21575,Angela,It was just you...
21576,Michael,"How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator."
21577,Angela,You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
21578,Angela,"Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading."
21579,Michael,Who's that? Who's that guy? 
21580,Angela,"Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide."
21581,Michael,"I guess this could be the one, huh?"
21582,Andy,I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
21583,Oscar, Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
21584,Michael,My last pay check?
21585,Oscar,You have an address yet in Colorado?
21586,Oscar,What town do Holly's parents live in?
21587,Michael,"I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?"
21588,Pam, You should do more stuff like that.
21589,Jim," Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us."
21590,Michael,"Nah, I'm almost done."
21591,Pam,So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
21592,Kevin,Finally! That old shredder sucked.
21593,Pam,"It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking."
21594,Kevin,"Yeah, it won't shred magazines."
21595,Pam,It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
21596,Jim,Did you break the shredder Kevin?
21597,Kevin,"No, it's just... that old shredder sucks.  Just get one that'll shred magazines."
21598,Pam,I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
21599,Michael," I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote.  I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. "
21600,Michael,Hi. What is the name of our town?
21601,Michael,"No, no. I just needed to hear your voice."
21602,Michael, Yes.  Yes my hero!
21603,Michael," Ohh, I miss you."
21604,Michael,Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
21605,Michael," Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four.  And I have said goodbye to half of them."
21606,Michael,"If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?"
21607,Michael," She was once my girl, and she is your girl now."
21608,Ryan,This is... totally unnecessary.
21609,Michael,You're not prone to seizures?
21610,Pam, So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
21611,Angela,See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
21612,Pam,"I don't, I don't think we sh-"
21613,Pam," Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue."
21614,Pam,"You know what, I think we should get some other input."
21615,Angela,"No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker."
21616,Pam,"Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later."
21617,Erin,You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
21618,Erin,I really think you should leave.
21619,Erin,"Can we talk about this later, I have to go."
21620,Michael,"I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage.  Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you."
21621,Darryl,"That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum."
21622,Michael,"Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer."
21623,Darryl,No. Can't let you do that Mike.
21624,Michael,No problem. Worth a try.
21625,Michael, Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
21626,Michael," Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. "
21627,Andy,I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
21628,Andy, What do I know?
21629,Michael," Catch you guys-  Catch you guys on the filippity flip.  Flippity flip!  Flippity flip!  Really?  Okay, see ya guys! "
21630,Erin,"I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else."
21631,Erin,"I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose."
21632,Erin,I'm not attracted to Kevin.
21633,Michael,"Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart.  And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will.  And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime."
21634,Michael,"Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?"
21635,Michael,"Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind."
21636,Michael,"Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. "
21637,Michael,So I wanted to give you that.  It's a letter of recommendation. 
21638,Dwight,"This is gonna be good.  To whom it may concern.  Good, real personal. Thanks Michael.  The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme.  That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary.  I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme.  Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this?  Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball.  Ohhh, yeah."
21639,Jim," Ahh, what happened to you?"
21640,Michael,You should see the other guy.
21641,Michael, Jim where is Pam?
21642,Jim,"Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders."
21643,Michael,But it is already three o'clock! 
21644,Michael," Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay."
21645,Michael,Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
21646,Michael," And you, why are you still here."
21647,Michael,"No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice?  A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. "
21648,Andy,"Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car."
21649,Andy," Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call."
21650,Andy, Hey!  Good job boss!
21651,Michael," Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! "
21652,Michael,What is this meeting about?
21653,Michael,"Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam.  And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four."
21654,Michael, Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
21655,Michael," Ummm... Hm... No.  No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in.  Oh hi everybody, it's Ping!  And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful!  I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!"
21656,Jim,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
21657,Michael,Sure.  Be right out!
21658,Jim," So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day."
21659,Jim,"What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?"
21660,Jim,You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
21661,Jim,"Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good."
21662,Michael,Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
21663,Jim,Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
21664,Michael," T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert.  You started with this company, as a fine young man..."
21665,Jim,You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
21666,Jim,"And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. "
21667,Michael, Oh shoot! That's my cab.
21668,Jim,"Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but..."
21669,Michael,"I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?"
21670,Jim," I will see you, tomorrow at lunch."
21671,Michael,I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
21672,Michael,"No no no, let me see.  Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em.  "
21673,Michael,"Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now.  She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed.  I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?"
21674,Michael," Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh!  This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest.  That's what she said! "
21675,Pam," No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly."
21676,Oscar,"These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?"
21677,Kevin,This all sounds great to me.  But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.
21678,Pam,Because of the flowers.
21679,Pam,"Dogwoods, or just the Earth."
21680,Pam,"Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla.  She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume."
21681,Pam,"Oh my God, he hates me!"
21682,Jim,No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
21683,Jim,"Every time there's a silence, your brain's like ""Heh-heh-huh-huh"" ."
21684,Pam,Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
21685,Jim,Careful. There is no inner circle.
21686,Andy,"Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah."
21687,Jim,"There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys."
21688,Kevin,"Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  Which doesn't exist."
21689,Dwight,"Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you. "
21690,Dwight,"It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun."
21691,Dwight,I think you'll find what you're looking for  over there.
21692,Kevin,"Yeah, I say we just go for it!"
21693,Jim,"That's Toys R Us, I think."
21694,Ryan,"Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure."
21695,Ryan,"The problem with having ""It"" or ""the X-factor"" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say."
21696,Ryan,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
21697,Ryan,"Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you."
21698,Ryan,I'd die for you too.
21699,Ryan," Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!"
21700,Ryan, You're the best. Thank you.
21701,Dwight,Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
21702,Dwight,"I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?"
21703,Jim," Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled ""administrative"" and ""assistant."""
21704,Darryl,"The winner: under ""Special Skills,"" Mr. Don Feiner put ""Juggling."" "
21705,Kevin,"Oh, I think it's 18 hundo."
21706,Pam,"Oh no, do you think it was stolen?"
21707,Andy,"I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself.  Got some extra balls!  Hey-hey-hey-ho!"
21708,Pam,"Oh wow, you weren't kidding."
21709,Kevin,Didn't drop a single ball!
21710,Pam, Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.
21711,Jim,What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
21712,Pam,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?
21713,Jim,He's good at his job. And I like working for him.
21714,Angela,"Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist."
21715,Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the ""v*g1n* Monologues"" called the ""pen1s Apologies."" So I know a thing or two."
21716,Angela,"Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?"
21717,Andy,How could I not see it? You're so right.
21718,Pam, Why don't you talk to him about it?
21719,Jim,"And say what? ""Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"""
21720,Pam,Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
21721,Andy,"And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his pen1s goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls?"
21722,Jim,"Hey, you got a second?"
21723,Jim,"Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --"
21724,Darryl," Hey, saw Jim come in. We meeting?"
21725,Jim,"If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --"
21726,Jim,"I know.  Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads."
21727,Jim,"Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --"
21728,Kevin,"That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  Kevin..."
21729,Ryan, So I am the new customer service supervisor.
21730,Ryan,And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
21731,Jim,"Hey, who'd you end up hiring?"
21732,Dwight,"What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all."
21733,Pam,"So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?"
21734,Ryan,"Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today."
21735,Pam,"So, umm, is this your first office job then?"
21736,Jim,"Oh yeah, did he text us?"
21737,Pam,"Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us."
21738,Jim,He didn't text me. 
21739,Angela,"Andy, what are you doing?"
21740,Andy,"I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  What's up, mancave! "
21741,Pam," Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you."
21742,Jim," Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest."
21743,Dwight,"So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?"
21744,Jim,"Well, there is no inner...circle."
21745,Dwight,"Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone."
21746,Andy,"Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --"
21747,Jim,So this is my life. Until I win the lottery . Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
21748,Pam,"So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer."
21749,Ryan,"Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all."
21750,Ryan,"Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly."
21751,Ryan,I did not see Rango.
21752,Ryan," Oh, close call! Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am."
21753,Pam," Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?"
21754,Darryl,Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha!
21755,Darryl,"The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese."
21756,Pam,"Okay, well it's just really loud."
21757,Jim,"You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours."
21758,Jim,"Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it."
21759,Dwight,"Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop."
21760,Dwight,"Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership."
21761,Jim,"Alright, there you go."
21762,Jim,"15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?"
21763,Jim,"Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?"
21764,Erin,Who should I say is calling?
21765,Pam,We could get Deangelo flowers.
21766,Dwight,"No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up."
21767,Jim,"All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? "
21768,Dwight,"Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? "
21769,Jim,Nope. Baskets have it.
21770,Jim,"So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised.  And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high."
21771,Jim," Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you.  That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy."
21772,Dwight," Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you.  Jordan, gather my things from my desk. "
21773,Pam,What have you done?
21774,Dwight,Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
21775,Pam,Can't stay there all day.
21776,Pam,Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
21777,Jim,You'd slow me down.
21778,Jim,"Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger.  We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours."
21779,Pam,Stop stalling! Come on.
21780,Dwight,"Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it.  Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself."
21781,Dwight,That's on a need-to-know basis.
21782,Erin,I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
21783,Dwight," General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection."
21784,Jim,"Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?"
21785,Dwight, Please take note of the new color-coding system.
21786,Dwight,Gotcha! Why are you late?
21787,Dwight,All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. 
21788,Andy,"In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so..."
21789,Andy,Sure. What's going on? 
21790,Andy,"No, this is horrifying."
21791,Andy,"We're just friends, okay?"
21792,Andy,"Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?"
21793,Dwight," Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?"
21794,Jim,"Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know."
21795,Dwight,You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
21796,Jim,"Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. "
21797,Dwight,"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist."
21798,Jim,"And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it. "
21799,Andy,"Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. "
21800,Dwight,I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
21801,Kevin, No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
21802,Pam,You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
21803,Erin, 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - 
21804,Erin,He's just gonna call back.
21805,Erin,Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
21806,Erin,"I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him."
21807,Jim,"Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic."
21808,Dwight,"Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue."
21809,Dwight,"The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business."
21810,Dwight,Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
21811,Jim,"I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so..."
21812,Dwight,Don't make me fire you.
21813,Jim,You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
21814,Dwight,Don't make me pre-fire you.
21815,Dwight,"Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired."
21816,Jim," If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then."
21817,Jim,"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, ""Well that's pretty premature to think,"" but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared."
21818,Dwight,"How you doing, Jordan?"
21819,Dwight,"Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly."
21820,Dwight,"Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster."
21821,Dwight," Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good.  Ohh...  Oh, what a day. What a day."
21822,Pam,"Dwight, are you carrying a gun?"
21823,Dwight,"The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me."
21824,Andy,"Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable."
21825,Dwight,"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster."
21826,Pam,Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
21827,Dwight,Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
21828,Kevin,You could put a banana in it.
21829,Dwight,Why would I put a banana in my holster?
21830,Kevin,"In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later."
21831,Pam,"Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo."
21832,Dwight,Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! 
21833,Andy,Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
21834,Oscar,My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
21835,Andy, Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
21836,Dwight,"No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun."
21837,Oscar,I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
21838,Angela,"Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD."
21839,Dwight,"Okay, why are you calling Jo?"
21840,Andy,I think I should go the hospital.
21841,Erin,I'll go with you.
21842,Darryl,What's wrong with you?
21843,Dwight,"Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!"
21844,Dwight," Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo!  Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est--  I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation."
21845,Dwight,Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
21846,Erin,Navy blue. Little red anchors.
21847,Dwight,I have no way of knowing if that's true.
21848,Dwight,"I just really, really think we should handle this internally."
21849,Ryan,"Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?"
21850,Dwight,"Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best."
21851,Dwight,"There he is! Our hero!  You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories."
21852,Andy,"Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal."
21853,Dwight,Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
21854,Andy,Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
21855,Darryl,"I was talking like this.  I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me."
21856,Dwight,American Idol? What? No.
21857,Dwight,"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition."
21858,Angela,Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
21859,Kevin,Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
21860,Dwight,I put everything back in the vending machine.
21861,Kevin,Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
21862,Pam,You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
21863,Jim,"Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good."
21864,Jim,"Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in ""Shagadelic, baby,"" at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?"
21865,Kevin," What the  is that?  Oh, my..."
21866,Dwight,"Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?"
21867,Jim,"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?"
21868,Dwight," Well, what can you do? Life."
21869,Andy,We have to clean this up now!
21870,Erin,She had so much -
21871,Andy,"Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying..."
21872,Andy,And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
21873,Dwight,"Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?"
21874,Kevin,"Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage."
21875,Dwight,"No, Kevin, come on."
21876,Kevin,"My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it."
21877,Kevin,"No, under the jacket."
21878,Dwight,"You're kidding me.  Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist."
21879,Kevin,I don't feel anything.
21880,Dwight,"Oh, it's so wet."
21881,Dwight,I can't. I can't push harder!
21882,Kevin,"Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. "
21883,Kevin,Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
21884,Dwight,Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
21885,Dwight,"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -"
21886,Dwight,"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps."
21887,Dwight,I take full responsibility.
21888,Dwight,Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
21889,Pam,You shot a gun off -
21890,Dwight,Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
21891,Dwight," Jo, please... I will -"
21892,Jim,"Hey, Dwight. What's up?"
21893,Jim,"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. "
21894,Angela," Four, one, seven, one..."
21895,Oscar,Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
21896,Angela,"Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight..."
21897,Angela,"Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six..."
21898,Kevin,"Oh, I hit three. I hit three."
21899,Jim,He never called a meeting.
21900,Pam,What are we doing?
21901,Pam,We need a new manager.
21902,Jim, Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
21903,Jim,You could just be saying it to get the job.
21904,Jim,"How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it."
21905,Jim,Did you just trademark that...
21906,Jim,"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right?  And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea."
21907,Darryl,"I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm...  bla-aaack!"
21908,Erin, It's good. I really hope you get it!
21909,Andy,"The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace."
21910,Erin,"Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair."
21911,Erin,You in the boss's chair!
21912,Andy,"In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and...  we'll see what Rosa comes back with."
21913,Erin, Did you hear anything?
21914,Erin,"So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but..."
21915,Erin,Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
21916,Erin,But why not find out.
21917,Pam, Should you really be so blatant about that?
21918,Dwight,"They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere."
21919,Pam,Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
21920,Dwight,Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
21921,Jim,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate."
21922,Jim,Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
21923,Angela," Okay.  How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens."
21924,Kevin,"The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize."
21925,Jim,"Can you...  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?"
21926,Jim," He creeps me out.  But, I think he might be a genius."
21927,Darryl,"Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk."
21928,Darryl,So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. 
21929,Darryl,Uh...  yes?! I was.  Little joke!
21930,Darryl,I thought that was your job.
21931,Jim,"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?"
21932,Darryl,"I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. "
21933,Jim," So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?"
21934,Darryl,I... I just thought you knew me.
21935,Jim,"Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that.  Cool? "
21936,Darryl,Let me...  Oh. Cool. 
21937,Dwight,What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview?  What are you doing..?  Stop trying to figure me out.
21938,Dwight,Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
21939,Dwight,"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring."
21940,Jim,Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
21941,Jim,Is this a bad time to be doing this?
21942,Angela,"It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?"
21943,Kevin,Yeah! Tell us a story.
21944,Angela,"Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?"
21945,Pam, Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
21946,Angela,"Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? "
21947,Angela,"Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. "
21948,Oscar,"Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings,  I'm a little excited.  But overall, horrified."
21949,Jim,Andy? You all set?
21950,Andy,"Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear."
21951,Erin,"I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course."
21952,Jim,"So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?"
21953,Andy,"For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... "
21954,Andy,"I wasn't acc-, accusing..."
21955,Andy,"Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone."
21956,Andy,Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
21957,Andy," Uh, 93 million miles."
21958,Andy,"Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and...  333,000 times heavier than the Earth,..."
21959,Andy," I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!"
21960,Darryl," Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say ""Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was...  Clippy."
21961,Pam,How is this on me?
21962,Pam,Hang up.  Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.  Intel has told us there were at least seven.
21963,Pam,They're the same picture.
21964,Jim,"Your department's just you, right?"
21965,Dwight, I want an interview.
21966,Dwight,What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
21967,Dwight,"Peepa, how is she?"
21968,Dwight,"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?"
21969,Jim,"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again."
21970,Dwight,"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel."
21971,Dwight,"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited s*x breaks for you and Pam..."
21972,Dwight,Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
21973,Jim,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes. "
21974,Jim,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?"
21975,Dwight,"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this."
21976,Dwight,Let me get that for you. 
21977,Oscar,Pam... I think Robert is gay.
21978,Pam,"The Senator?  He was married before, and he has a kid."
21979,Pam,And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
21980,Oscar,I have a very strong suspicion.
21981,Pam,Did you see him at a bathhouse?
21982,Pam,The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
21983,Pam,Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
21984,Oscar,My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
21985,Pam,You're in the gay mafia.
21986,Oscar,"You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older.  You sound ignorant."
21987,Ryan,"You guys, um, talking Senator?"
21988,Oscar,No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
21989,Ryan,'Cause he's totally gay? 
21990,Ryan,"Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He ""liked"" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning."
21991,Erin, I... I don't think I can do that.
21992,Erin,"Well, that's not my personality."
21993,Erin,I do really want him.
21994,Darryl,"So, uh... here you go. "
21995,Darryl,Hope it's all right.
21996,Jim,I'm sure it's fine.
21997,Darryl,"The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?"
21998,Darryl,"Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about."
21999,Darryl,Yes. How did he do?
22000,Jim,He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
22001,Darryl,Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
22002,Jim,Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. 
22003,Jim,"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?"
22004,Jim,I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
22005,Oscar,Is there a front runner?
22006,Jim,You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
22007,Oscar,"Well, there must be someone who stands out."
22008,Jim,"No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat."
22009,Ryan," Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever..."
22010,Jim,"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise."
22011,Ryan,Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. 
22012,Jim,"No, was it good?"
22013,Darryl,"Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced."
22014,Dwight," Jo, may I speak to you for a second?"
22015,Dwight,"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position."
22016,Pam,I'm a woman. I would want to know.
22017,Kevin,"Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot."
22018,Oscar,"You have met a lesbian in real life, right?"
22019,Pam,She does seem happy.
22020,Oscar,You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
22021,Kevin,We don't tell her.
22022,Pam,"Uh, just put him through to me."
22023,Pam,Hello! This is... the client.
22024,Erin," Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim."
22025,Erin, He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
22026,Jim," Oh, I know this guy.  Hello! Mr. ""Soo-ven-yay."" Mr. ""Jacques Soo-ven-yay."" Nice to meet you. It says here you're French.  So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager."
22027,Jim,Assistant to the Regional Manager.
22028,Jim,"Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty."
22029,Dwight,Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo...  It's me. I'm Dwight.
22030,Jim," No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... "
22031,Dwight,"I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!"
22032,Jim,"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, ""just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."""
22033,Jim,Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
22034,Jim,"Oh, I didn't know you knew her?"
22035,Jim,"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit."
22036,Oscar,"Erin, what are you doing?"
22037,Erin,I've been turned into a puppet!
22038,Kevin," Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?"
22039,Erin,I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
22040,Kevin," Yeah. Low blow, puppet."
22041,Erin,And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
22042,Kevin,"It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F..."
22043,Erin, I need the most special thing in the office.
22044,Erin,A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! 
22045,Andy,Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
22046,Erin, I've done it all my life.
22047,Andy,"Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should."
22048,Andy,"Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know?  Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football...  Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry.  I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though."
22049,Angela," Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350."
22050,Angela,"I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?"
22051,Pam,That was our dream wedding.
22052,Angela,Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
22053,Pam," I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela."
22054,Jim,"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know."
22055,Dwight,You have to interview me...
22056,Jim,I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
22057,Dwight,I demand more questions!
22058,Jim," All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss."
22059,Dwight,"Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it."
22060,Dwight,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again?  That's a great question.  I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing."
22061,Dwight,"Thank you.  You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive.  Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. "
22062,Jim,"Well, that was quick."
22063,Jim,He's not a real candidate.
22064,Jim,You took the deal.
22065,Jim,What is happening right now?
22066,Jim,"No, why would you think that?"
22067,Jim,"Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss."
22068,Jim,"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen."
22069,Dwight,"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad."
22070,Jim,Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
22071,Andy,Tuna... You're completely sane.
22072,Andy,"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?"
22073,Jim,"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?"
22074,Kevin,Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
22075,Jim, I suppose I am.
22076,Kevin,Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see.  what do 'I' want?...
22077,Oscar,"I don't think he meant, that--"
22078,Kevin,So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
22079,Kevin,What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who...  Everyone is listening to me. 
22080,Oscar,I think it should be Darryl.
22081,Dwight,What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
22082,Oscar,Kelly's on your side.
22083,Andy,"Whoever it is, I think they should be lame.  Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality."
22084,Ryan,I want an outsider.
22085,Jim,Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
22086,Ryan,"No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person."
22087,Pam,A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
22088,Ryan,"No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it."
22089,Pam,"No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person."
22090,Ryan,"Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?"
22091,Ryan,"I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led."
22092,Andy,She may have a point there... would a small pen1s work? Small-to-moderate.
22093,Pam,"Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you."
22094,Dwight,"We're gonna miss you, Gabe. "
22095,Andy," Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes."
22096,Erin,"I see it.  I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of  and facing, and I'm like..."
22097,Jim,"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?"
22098,Angela,"Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-"
22099,Darryl," Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing?  Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting."
22100,Darryl," Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges."
22101,Darryl,"Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. "
22102,Jim,"What? No, no, it's not a vote."
22103,Jim,I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
22104,Jim,"No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work.  We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay?  What the hell happened out there? "
22105,Andy,Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
22106,Darryl,"Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am."
22107,Dwight,"I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or...  I don't know. Something always works out. "
22108,Oscar,"Oh, for God's sake. "
22109,Oscar,"Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That's it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet."
22110,Erin,"Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don't.  And I don't.  But I am so excited to be a part of it."
22111,Andy, After you my good sir.
22112,Jim,"The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California... for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.  He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.   And he chose..."
22113,Andy," I... it's unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice's first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ""I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer."" Smart, right?"
22114,Andy,"Uh, this has got to stop."
22115,Dwight,"Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great."
22116,Dwight,"K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?"
22117,Pam,I don't think I should.
22118,Pam,Right here. Little Michael Scott- 
22119,Jim,"No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early."
22120,Pam,Much different the second time around. And I have to say
22121,Angela,"Look, it's a �Little Pregs'  and �Big Pregs' "
22122,Pam,"Wait, when did we start calling it that-"
22123,Angela,"Isn't it amazing, the difference in our sizes?"
22124,Pam,"Well, I am a few months ahead of you."
22125,Angela,"I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman."
22126,Dwight,"Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. "
22127,Darryl,"Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin' much better. This soda. This is mine."
22128,Jim,No one should be planking at all.
22129,Andy,"Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?"
22130,Dwight," Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous.  �Specially with me around."
22131,Jim,"You watching that commercial again?  Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?"
22132,Pam,"Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone."
22133,Jim,He's got a bank vault. That's a start.
22134,Jim,"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange."
22135,Erin,Robert California. Let's have a conversation.
22136,Erin,"Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-"
22137,Erin,"Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I've been doing this thing-"
22138,Andy,"Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning."
22139,Andy,"First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don't know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client."
22140,Erin,"Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. "
22141,Jim, Can I call you right back? Thank you very much.  Okay.  What is this?
22142,Andy,The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
22143,Andy,"Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?"
22144,Dwight,What are you looking at?
22145,Dwight,It can't be nothing.
22146,Jim,"It's just a list of our names, split into two columns."
22147,Jim,"Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?"
22148,Jim,"No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?"
22149,Pam,"If he comes out, distract him. "
22150,Kevin,We need a warning signal.
22151,Jim,"We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-"
22152,Jim,"I promise you, we don't need a warning-"
22153,Kevin,WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
22154,Dwight,Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
22155,Dwight,"Okay, which side of the list am I on?"
22156,Jim,Why are you- How do you know?
22157,Andy,Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
22158,Jim,"Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook."
22159,Pam,He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
22160,Andy,"Oh, okay. I don't want any part of this."
22161,Pam,Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire.
22162,Jim,"Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make."
22163,Dwight,This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an �Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.
22164,Andy,"I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam."
22165,Jim,I don't think it's-
22166,Dwight,"Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider."
22167,Angela,Did you guys figure it out?
22168,Andy,We couldn't crack it.
22169,Andy,He'll know that we looked at his private notebook.
22170,Andy,I'm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
22171,Andy,"What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk."
22172,Andy,And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
22173,Andy,It's a photocopy from your notebook.
22174,Andy,No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
22175,Andy,"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?"
22176,Andy,"Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?"
22177,Andy,"Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?"
22178,Andy,"Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys."
22179,Kevin,I know! It's alphabetical.
22180,Dwight,"No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... ATTACK!"
22181,Jim,"Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! "
22182,Dwight,That's great. Let's do this guys.
22183,Jim,"Alright, well, I will see you in a bit."
22184,Pam,I love you so much. 
22185,Jim,Hey. It's nothing. Alright? I'll text you when we get there. Let you know what's going on.
22186,Jim,Nope. No dog video.
22187,Jim,Okay. See you guys.
22188,Andy,"Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!"
22189,Jim,"Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo."
22190,Jim,"Yeah, she does like Elmo."
22191,Oscar,Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
22192,Darryl,"Apt. Apt analysis, Robert."
22193,Kevin,The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
22194,Andy,Great group! Pizza party!
22195,Andy,"Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here."
22196,Andy,Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
22197,Andy,Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
22198,Dwight,"You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?"
22199,Dwight,"Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!"
22200,Andy,Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
22201,Pam," Oh, text from Jim. ""This is getting very weird. Will explain later."""
22202,Pam," Oh, text from Kevin."
22203,Ryan,"Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn't the fact that I'm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!"
22204,Pam,"I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ""Who's that receptionist? I like her."" Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you're like, ""Oh, loser."""
22205,Andy,"C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?"
22206,Dwight,"Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy."
22207,Kevin,"I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone."
22208,Jim,"Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?"
22209,Andy,"When I was a salesman I could just be like ""Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob."" Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob."
22210,Andy,"Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier."
22211,Andy,Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?
22212,Andy,"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?"
22213,Erin,"Andy, don't go in there!"
22214,Andy,I'm going in there.
22215,Andy,"I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list."
22216,Andy,"Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?"
22217,Andy,"Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word ""no"" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with."
22218,Dwight,"Jim, shut the door. This is just gross."
22219,Andy,"Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one."
22220,Erin,I like my new group. I liked my old group.
22221,Andy,"Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we're gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend."
22222,Andy,"Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday."
22223,Andy,"Well, you got it this year too."
22224,Jim,"Alright, I'm gonna go warm up the car."
22225,Pam,"Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?"
22226,Pam,"Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but-  I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No.  It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it."
22227,Jim,"Hey, so this isn't matching up with this...and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?"
22228,Jim,"Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?"
22229,Kevin,Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.
22230,Pam,"Kevin, do you feel OK?"
22231,Kevin,Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.
22232,Pam,"Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital."
22233,Jim,"Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?"
22234,Angela,He's always been like that.
22235,Angela,"I mean, he's gotten worse over the years...."
22236,Oscar,He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
22237,Kevin,You keep think that.
22238,Kevin,"Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ""car no go"", and we best friends. So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?"
22239,Andy,"Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do."
22240,Andy,"Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk."
22241,Kevin,But save time. More success.
22242,Jim,Does it save time though? �Cause we've been here for about an hour.
22243,Pam,"Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time."
22244,Kevin,Many small time make big time.
22245,Andy,What are you gonna do with all this time?
22246,Pam,"Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world."
22247,Jim,"K, Kevin, are you saying ""See the world""? or ""Sea World?"""
22248,Kevin,See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.
22249,Jim,"No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. �Cause I still don't know if you're saying ""Sea World"" or ""see the world,"" and it's taking a lot of time to explain it."
22250,Kevin,"Fine, fine. I'll talk normally."
22251,Kevin,"When me President, they see.  They see."
22252,Dwight,This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid. 
22253,Dwight,"So, you can tell your clients: ""Unleash the power of the pyramid."""
22254,Pam,It's huge. How much does it weigh?
22255,Dwight,"Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds."
22256,Ryan,How much memory does it have without the booster?
22257,Jim,How many L to a K?
22258,Dwight,You're really going to want the booster.
22259,Andy,"Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting."
22260,Andy,"I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more?  What do you think, C-SPAN?"
22261,Andy,"Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause......"
22262,Dwight,Is this really the best use of our collective time?
22263,Andy,"I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank."
22264,Dwight," OK, let's look at some ties."
22265,Dwight,"Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise."
22266,Dwight, Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
22267,Erin,"Um, D-Dog, you have a message."
22268,Pam,"Erin, you don't need to call him that."
22269,Erin,"Andy wants us to, P-Dog."
22270,Darryl,"It's ok E-Dog, just who called?"
22271,Erin,Justine. She said she's coming by later.
22272,Kevin,"Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?"
22273,Darryl,No no no no. I like her.
22274,Kevin,Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman.
22275,Darryl,"Nah man, we get along now. Real well."
22276,Jim,Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.
22277,Darryl,"Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex wife last night.... I have to sing it.  We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo."
22278,Andy, Hi Dad!...... Ahhh....oh boy.
22279,Erin,Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here?
22280,Andy,Are you factoring in the... whole national ...economy.... declining and all that?
22281,Andy,I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?
22282,Andy,You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason?
22283,Andy,Can I inspire?  I don't know!.....I don't know.
22284,Erin,"I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said ""coffee""...."
22285,Andy,Why don't we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
22286,Erin,"Andy, you don't want that."
22287,Andy,I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee.  Mmm....
22288,Andy,"You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance...."
22289,Oscar,Let me call you back.
22290,Kevin,This is where we go
22291,Kevin,There are no wrong answers.
22292,Andy,"Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time."
22293,Andy,"What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem..."
22294,Jim,Why don't you start?
22295,Andy,"If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?"
22296,Andy,OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.
22297,Jim,He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
22298,Dwight,"We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house."
22299,Andy,"You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be?  Tuna."
22300,Jim,"New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door..."
22301,Andy,Fart..... good Sesh.  That leg's asleep.
22302,Kevin,"Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here."
22303,Darryl," rub a dub dub...I got scrubbed. �Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine.  This is Jim and Oscar, everybody."
22304,Darryl,"Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today."
22305,Andy,D-Bone. There you are.
22306,Dwight,"Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?"
22307,Andy,"No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about..."
22308,Dwight,Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.
22309,Andy,"Yeah...um, how is everything?"
22310,Dwight,Good. Really really good.
22311,Andy,Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
22312,Dwight,"Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back."
22313,Andy,Oof. What are you gonna do about that?
22314,Dwight,"I don't know, what do you mean?"
22315,Andy,There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...
22316,Dwight,"You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job!  And I'll do mine..... walnuts?"
22317,Angela,Have you seen this? 
22318,Pam,Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
22319,Jim,"She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces."
22320,Angela,Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
22321,Pam,I flipped through it.
22322,Angela,So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?
22323,Angela,I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?
22324,Jim,You have a walking buddy.
22325,Andy,Thanks for coming in guys.
22326,Andy,Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.
22327,Andy,This is what's under the blanket.
22328,Oscar,We don't get it.
22329,Andy,"These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves: ""Well, how does this work?"""
22330,Pam,"Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes."
22331,Andy,You're exactly right and you get a point.
22332,Ryan,"Uh, is that a vibrator?"
22333,Andy,"I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear."
22334,Andy,"There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt."
22335,Andy,"Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very... Sari.  Sixteen points."
22336,Jim,What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
22337,Andy,That's a crazy amount of points.
22338,Andy,"Well, what do you want?"
22339,Jim,"I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy."
22340,Andy,"Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. "
22341,Jim,"That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?"
22342,Andy,"I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong.  Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard!"
22343,Jim,"Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?"
22344,Andy,"Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!"
22345,Jim,"Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work."
22346,Jim,"I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much.  Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?"
22347,Andy,Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
22348,Jim,"No, I didn't notice anything."
22349,Andy,Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years....and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.
22350,Jim,"I don't know what to tell you, man."
22351,Andy,You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
22352,Jim,"Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass."
22353,Andy,Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
22354,Jim,"Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. "
22355,Andy,Hundred and twenty points.
22356,Jim,"Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though... Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. "
22357,Pam,Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's?
22358,Jim,"and I'm back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?"
22359,Andy,"Hey Kevin, what are you doing?"
22360,Kevin,Don't talk to me! 
22361,Andy," Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey there, um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here...De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale...uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. "
22362,Andy,Took �em one day.
22363,Pam,"Ready!  ""I'm not as think as you drunk I am!"" "
22364,Ryan,"I like it, I like it! "
22365,Andy,"OK, keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car  for a thousand points....or best offer."
22366,Pam,"Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea... So nasty Phyllis!"
22367,Pam,We were hoping you could do something like this...
22368,Andy,We should think about this...does anyone have any better ideas?
22369,Andy,Just need a second outside.
22370,Jim,"Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this..."
22371,Andy,Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ....Confession: I don't know what I'm doing.
22372,Jim,"I mean, do you like it? You having fun?  Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun....and you did that."
22373,Andy,"My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday."
22374,Jim,"But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea....which, by the way, I can't wait for."
22375,Andy,"No one expects me to go through with this, right?"
22376,Andy,My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
22377,Andy,"They are already off, my good sir."
22378,Andy,"Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there."
22379,Pam,Do you think you could work from this?  we made some small adjustments.
22380,Pam,Just a few adjustments
22381,Andy,This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
22382,Andy,"Invest in softer cotton, sir.  OW! Oh! Oooh!  oh, whoa!!"
22383,Dwight,"Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it."
22384,Andy," It's a Nard Dog!  That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!"
22385,Jim,Pull up your pants.
22386,Pam,"Um, what should we talk about?"
22387,Angela,"Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having."
22388,Pam,"Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help."
22389,Angela,"A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it."
22390,Pam,"Angela, that's pretty transparently me."
22391,Pam,You know it's just herbal tea.
22392,Angela,In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
22393,Pam,Yeah. I think you should call social services.
22394,Pam,"You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together."
22395,Dwight,....back orders and you never called them.
22396,Oscar,Can you believe this?
22397,Erin,There's a dog in the car.
22398,Oscar,"You can't leave a dog in a parked car.  Snowboarder, it figures."
22399,Jim,Do Snowboarders hate animals?
22400,Oscar,I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
22401,Andy,"Oscar, it's not that hot out."
22402,Darryl,A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
22403,Andy,"Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight."
22404,Kevin,"Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog."
22405,Dwight,"OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy.  Come on."
22406,Jim,Dwight! At least aim it.
22407,Dwight,"There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on."
22408,Andy,We're losing cloud cover.
22409,Darryl,"Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time."
22410,Oscar,This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. 
22411,Jim,Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
22412,Oscar,"Come on buddy, get back."
22413,Dwight,"Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! "
22414,Jim,"Alright! Nice job, Oscar!"
22415,Oscar,And one for good measure! 
22416,Jim,"So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?"
22417,Oscar,Why would we take the dog?
22418,Jim,What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
22419,Oscar,"Jim, he's not gonna star- "
22420,Oscar,"Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay."
22421,Jim,"Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?"
22422,Oscar, There we go. That should do it.
22423,Jim,"Yeah, that's pretty good."
22424,Pam,"What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?"
22425,Jim,"Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars."
22426,Andy,"The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus.  This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things."
22427,Darryl," Hello?....Justine!  Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right-  Whoops."
22428,Darryl,"When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ... playing my birthday."
22429,Oscar,What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
22430,Jim,"I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money."
22431,Dwight,"I know what you'd do with all that money.  ""Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug."""
22432,Jim,"No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop."
22433,Pam,"And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?"
22434,Jim,Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
22435,Pam,I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
22436,Ryan,SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
22437,Pam,"And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting..."
22438,Pam,And then my handsome husband...
22439,Jim,Which ideally would be me....
22440,Pam,Would bring me a flavored coffee.
22441,Jim,Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
22442,Pam,Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
22443,Jim,"I don't know about Stephen King, I mean..."
22444,Andy,"Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone.  To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day.  Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?"
22445,Andy,"What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?"
22446,Andy,Are they on their way over?
22447,Darryl,I haven't hired anyone.
22448,Darryl,I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
22449,Andy,This is kinda time sensitive.
22450,Darryl,I got it. I'm doin' it.
22451,Andy,"Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? "
22452,Erin,As long as you guys don't need me up here.
22453,Dwight,I think we'll be fine. 
22454,Oscar,"Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?"
22455,Oscar,Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. 
22456,Andy,Jim! How 'bout you?
22457,Jim,"Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you..."
22458,Dwight,"Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god.  False. Andy, I will volunteer."
22459,Kevin,Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
22460,Pam,"Wait, wait. What's this? "
22461,Angela,"Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool."
22462,Pam,"It says ""Lotto Pool"", right on top. "
22463,Angela,Yeah. And I said sorry.
22464,Pam,Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
22465,Darryl,When did I get so fat?
22466,Darryl,I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
22467,Andy,Where are we in the process?
22468,Darryl,"I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process."
22469,Andy,Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
22470,Darryl,The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
22471,Andy,You do have a fantastic basement.
22472,Darryl,I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
22473,Andy,"Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go...there he is."
22474,Andy,That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
22475,Jim,"OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad."
22476,Dwight,"Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! "
22477,Jim,Nice.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
22478,Andy,"Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?"
22479,Darryl,You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
22480,Andy,"Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?"
22481,Darryl,"One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. "
22482,Andy,"Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great.  maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut.  Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?"
22483,Andy,"You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so..."
22484,Darryl,Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
22485,Andy,"Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about."
22486,Andy,"We need you, OK?"
22487,Dwight, What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. 
22488,Erin,I didn't feel anything.
22489,Andy,"Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor."
22490,Darryl,Why do you wanna work here?
22491,Darryl,That's not a good reason.
22492,Andy,Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
22493,Darryl,"Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you're still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change."
22494,Andy,Are we scaring them straight....?
22495,Darryl,I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
22496,Darryl,"I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?"
22497,Ryan,Nice. Right back where I like you.  Can you make ten copies of this for me?
22498,Ryan,Why not? What are you doing?
22499,Pam,"Uh, buying lottery tickets online. "
22500,Ryan,"Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it."
22501,Pam,"You came in at 10:30 today, right?"
22502,Ryan,"OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????"
22503,Andy,"No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind."
22504,Andy,"No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now."
22505,Kevin," OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back."
22506,Jim,There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
22507,Dwight,"Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday."
22508,Jim,Yeah  Not that they're not smart people.
22509,Dwight," No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence."
22510,Jim,I'd go with that.
22511,Dwight,Like baboons or elephants.
22512,Kevin,"Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh."
22513,Jim,"It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-"
22514,Kevin,Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
22515,Erin," You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! "
22516,Andy,Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap?  You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
22517,Darryl,Did you hire 'em?
22518,Andy,No. Because they all left.
22519,Darryl,"What do you mean ""they left""?"
22520,Andy,"I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help."
22521,Darryl,Then I think you should fire me.
22522,Andy,What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
22523,Darryl,Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
22524,Andy,".....OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke."
22525,Darryl,No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
22526,Andy,"So Darryl says to me ""fire me"". But what he really means is ""I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means."" So I say ""No, you're not fired."" But what I really mean is ""I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.""........I really hope that's what he and I mean."
22527,Andy,"Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy."
22528,Oscar,Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
22529,Andy,Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
22530,Oscar,"Oh, he's plenty strong."
22531,Oscar,"It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell."
22532,Pam,"So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings...."
22533,Pam,"And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France."
22534,Jim,"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it."
22535,Pam,"Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy."
22536,Jim,"Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. "
22537,Dwight,"Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?"
22538,Andy,Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
22539,Andy,"Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse."
22540,Andy,"Eh, cool. We'll figure that out."
22541,Andy,Got it. Dually noted. You!  Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
22542,Andy,So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
22543,Dwight,"Message in a Bottle, The Postman..."
22544,Kevin,So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
22545,Erin,You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
22546,Jim,"So, it's not the dumbest idea."
22547,Dwight,It's not the greatest one either...
22548,Jim,"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes."
22549,Dwight,And it's clear we're not going to carry them. 
22550,Jim,"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table."
22551,Kevin,I think we're ready to give thi-  Jim?
22552,Dwight,Yep. He'll be fine.
22553,Andy,Surprise! Your new crew.
22554,Darryl,"Would you just fire me, man?"
22555,Andy,Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
22556,Darryl,You wanna make me happy? Huh?
22557,Darryl,Give me your job.
22558,Darryl,"I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me."
22559,Andy,"I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that."
22560,Andy,"Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?"
22561,Andy,"He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?"
22562,Andy,"None, no part of this has anything to do with you."
22563,Darryl,I didn't have time because of my daughter.
22564,Andy,"Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class."
22565,Darryl,Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
22566,Andy,Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. 
22567,Darryl,"OK, don't fire me."
22568,Darryl,My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
22569,Darryl,"I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch."
22570,Andy,"Yeah.  That makes sense. OK. Good, alright."
22571,Andy,What is goin' on?! 
22572,Darryl,Why is the forklift in the wall?
22573,Andy,Why is the truck empty?
22574,Dwight,"Uh, it's not totally empty."
22575,Darryl,Is that grease on my floor?
22576,Dwight,"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this."
22577,Darryl,And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
22578,Kevin,"OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them."
22579,Jim,"OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things."
22580,Erin,Jim? Tell them what it's called.
22581,Kevin,"No Jim, tell 'em what a name is."
22582,Jim,"Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid."
22583,Kevin," Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim."
22584,Jim,"That's OK, we're good."
22585,Andy,"No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein."
22586,Jim,Porque es muy rapido.
22587,Dwight,"OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away."
22588,Darryl,Let me see it.
22589,Dwight,"It's uh, it's in beta testing."
22590,Darryl,Let me see it!
22591,Dwight,"Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping."
22592,Pam,We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
22593,Jim,Right. It's city and country combined.
22594,Pam,Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
22595,Jim,And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
22596,Jim, Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
22597,Jim,But what are you gonna do about that?
22598,Pam,What are you gonna do?
22599,Jim," Hey. So, we saw a new billboard."
22600,Andy,"Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?"
22601,Andy,What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
22602,Jim,"You've seen it, right?"
22603,Pam,"Andy, somebody defaced it."
22604,Jim,"There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity."
22605,Andy,"Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?"
22606,Andy,"Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company."
22607,Andy,Which one did you see?
22608,Jim,"Okay, don't be gross."
22609,Pam,Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
22610,Dwight,"Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?"
22611,Dwight,"No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!  No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO!  NOOOOOOOOO!"
22612,Dwight,"Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far."
22613,Ryan,Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
22614,Dwight,It's simpler this way.
22615,Andy,"Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m."
22616,Andy,It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
22617,Andy,You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
22618,Andy,"Few other super simple reminders � no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?"
22619,Darryl,"What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?"
22620,Andy,"I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up."
22621,Oscar,"Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children."
22622,Andy,"This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party."
22623,Darryl,There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
22624,Andy,"Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules."
22625,Pam,How is that better than a barbecue?
22626,Ryan,What's the dress code on this?
22627,Andy,I'm glad you asked � Connecticut Casual.
22628,Andy,"Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. "
22629,Kevin,"Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this."
22630,Darryl,"I've seen this, that's not you."
22631,Andy,"It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time."
22632,Jim,"Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?"
22633,Andy,"Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did. "
22634,Andy,"See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time."
22635,Dwight,"And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you."
22636,Jim," So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. "
22637,Dwight,They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
22638,Jim,"Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?"
22639,Dwight,There's so much more to it than that.
22640,Dwight,"I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon.  Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. "
22641,Jim,I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.  I've only sold one copy.
22642,Angela,Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
22643,Angela,I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
22644,Pam,"Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier."
22645,Pam,"Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather."
22646,Angela,Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
22647,Pam," Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather."
22648,Angela,It's after my cat.
22649,Andy,"Ooh, that sounds great."
22650,Andy,"Uh, I'll hear the other one."
22651,Andy,"You know, the marmalade sounds great."
22652,Andy,Then the basil will be fine.
22653,Jim,"Chapter 2 � Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present."
22654,Dwight,"STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!"
22655,Andy,"How's it going over here, guys?"
22656,Oscar,"Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying."
22657,Andy,"Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table."
22658,Dwight,MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
22659,Andy,"Well, technically FOR Andy."
22660,Oscar,Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
22661,Andy,I don't know how you got there.
22662,Andy,"This branch, I'm the regional manager."
22663,Andy,"Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less."
22664,Andy,Can I introduce you around now?
22665,Andy,What are you going to see?
22666,Andy,I didn't know you were going to be here.
22667,Jim,"Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim."
22668,Jim,"No, no, no, no, no. No."
22669,Dwight,Set that down.  Present yourself.
22670,Jim,Chapter 4 � One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
22671,Dwight,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!"
22672,Andy,"Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad."
22673,Andy,"Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade."
22674,Ryan,"This is not funny, man, let me down."
22675,Kevin,I think this thing is broken.
22676,Ryan,"It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works."
22677,Andy,"Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff."
22678,Andy,"Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity."
22679,Andy,"Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?"
22680,Darryl,"Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! "
22681,Angela,"I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!"
22682,Pam,"I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!"
22683,Angela,She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
22684,Ryan,I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides.
22685,Erin,I think we should toast...
22686,Dwight,Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
22687,Jim,"Chapter 9 � The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party."
22688,Kevin,Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
22689,Andy,You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
22690,Andy,"Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!"
22691,Andy,"Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets? "
22692,Andy, Saying I love you is not the words...
22693,Andy,"Right, it feels strange."
22694,Andy,Saying I love... Saying I love you...
22695,Andy,Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
22696,Erin, It's either taping or calling.
22697,Andy," Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar."
22698,Ryan,That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
22699,Dwight,"My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?"
22700,Dwight,"Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?"
22701,Dwight,"I can get you exotic meats � hippo steaks, giraffe burgers..."
22702,Dwight,It'll all be goat.
22703,Andy,"Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call."
22704,Andy,"I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me."
22705,Andy,"I know, I know that you're proud of me."
22706,Darryl,"I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too."
22707,Oscar,Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
22708,Oscar,It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
22709,Darryl,"I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed."
22710,Oscar,Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
22711,Ryan,Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
22712,Andy,"Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry."
22713,Pam,What are they doing?
22714,Jim,I think I left my wallet in your house.
22715,Jim,"I didn't forget them, they're right here."
22716,Jim,"I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing..."
22717,Dwight,MIS... MI... What are you doing?
22718,Jim,"Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?"
22719,Dwight,"That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!"
22720,Andy," Chef from South Park, it's genius!"
22721,Andy,"I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously."
22722,Kevin,The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
22723,Andy,"Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert."
22724,Kevin,"It's been out for ages, man."
22725,Andy,"Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that."
22726,Andy,Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
22727,Andy,"Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just..."
22728,Andy,I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
22729,Andy,"Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?"
22730,Andy,There you go. Thank you.
22731,Erin,"When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day."
22732,Kevin,"Jim, put it on."
22733,Darryl,"Put it on, man."
22734,Jim,I don't know if I can.
22735,Kevin,"Come on, the Three Amigos."
22736,Jim,"I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh."
22737,Ryan," If you get into season 1, you can really..."
22738,Dwight,It's called a costume.
22739,Dwight,"Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?"
22740,Dwight,"Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault."
22741,Andy,"Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?"
22742,Andy,"I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - ""Boo!"" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - ""Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high."" Scared the s**t out of me."
22743,Andy,"G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?"
22744,Pam, What are you doing?
22745,Erin,"Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't."
22746,Erin,"That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?"
22747,Erin,"Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?"
22748,Erin,"That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear."
22749,Pam,"No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?"
22750,Erin,"Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny."
22751,Oscar,I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
22752,Pam,"Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello."
22753,Pam,"Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story..."
22754,Pam,"...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black."
22755,Jim,No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
22756,Jim,"Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?"
22757,Pam,What do you mean?
22758,Jim,"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?"
22759,Pam,I saw a ghost.
22760,Jim,"Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?"
22761,Pam,"It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date."
22762,Jim,"Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it."
22763,Pam,"I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost."
22764,Andy,"Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!"
22765,Erin,"Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?"
22766,Andy,"Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool."
22767,Erin,"Oh, I put those up."
22768,Angela,I know. I'm taking them down.
22769,Erin,"I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so..."
22770,Angela,"Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?"
22771,Angela,"So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this."
22772,Dwight,"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul."
22773,Dwight,Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
22774,Dwight,Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
22775,Dwight,"Yeah, but no nipples."
22776,Erin,"November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!"
22777,Erin,"Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?"
22778,Andy,"Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG."
22779,Erin,"But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?"
22780,Andy,"Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call."
22781,Erin,"Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can."
22782,Andy, Yes.  I don't know. Mmhmm.
22783,Erin,I'm throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.
22784,Erin,Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn't stop crying?
22785,Erin,"Ok. Let's say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just... more adult... more... scary and sexy"
22786,Erin,No � just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
22787,Erin,What are you thinking?
22788,Jim,Hey it's Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I've read a lot about this really great documentary.
22789,Pam,Is it called Ghostbusters?
22790,Pam,It didn't look like that.
22791,Jim,It didn't have a buster sign around him? Why don't you draw him? Why don't we see this whole thing.
22792,Pam,Ok fine I'll draw him. 
22793,Jim,I ain't fraid of no ghost.  Whoa!
22794,Pam,Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?
22795,Dwight,It's a root you idiot.
22796,Dwight,That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.
22797,Dwight,Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane's coming. I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
22798,Jim,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
22799,Kevin,I'm only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies.
22800,Oscar,Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums.
22801,Kevin, Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
22802,Erin,I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!
22803,Jim,Party looks fun doesn't it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
22804,Angela,Pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before? When I wasn't pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
22805,Oscar,Hey guys. I'm an Oscar  liar  weiner.
22806,Darryl,This party's tight. The fog is cool.
22807,Erin,Thanks. It's on medium.
22808,Andy,It really looks great. You did a great job.
22809,Erin,"Oh, so we don't have to have that talk."
22810,Andy,We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45?  Cool.
22811,Erin, Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok. 
22812,Oscar, Is that my grandmother?
22813,Oscar,There is no story.
22814,Andy,I think we've seen enough. You can turn it off now.  Yeah turn it off now.
22815,Oscar,Where is this from? That is so upsetting!
22816,Andy,That was awful. Robert I apologize.
22817,Erin,"I'm sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now . This game is called ""pecker Poker"".  It's the game of cards that gets you hard."
22818,Andy,What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
22819,Erin,All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so...
22820,Andy,Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn't.  I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
22821,Andy,Ok. Erin I think you know I've been dating someone.
22822,Andy,And it's getting a little more serious. She's never come by.
22823,Erin,And she's never called here. Unless it's your mom.
22824,Andy,No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it's weird that she's not calling.
22825,Erin,Two dates? Three dates?
22826,Erin,Wow. I'm so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I'll see you guys.
22827,Darryl,"I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person."
22828,Pam,Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
22829,Jim,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win."
22830,Jim,No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
22831,Dwight,"Go, get up there right now."
22832,Dwight,"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B."
22833,Erin,"I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest."
22834,Erin,"I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city."
22835,Darryl,"Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive."
22836,Jim,"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, ""Mom, there's a ghost in my closet."" Now, you say one of two things - one, ""You're just having a bad dream,"" or two, ""Let's go see what it was."""
22837,Pam,"I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim."
22838,Pam,"I'm not gonna lie to her, either."
22839,Andy, Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. 
22840,Andy,"Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird."
22841,Andy,One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
22842,Jim,"Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing."
22843,Pam,Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times.  Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
22844,Andy,"I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home.  I know who I want to take me home.  Take me hooo...hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing... no traditions!"
22845,Andy,Whose your favorite iron chef?
22846,Andy,Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes...
22847,Dwight,Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all. 
22848,Dwight,"Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted ""We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants."
22849,Andy,Umpf...that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
22850,Andy,"They're both Kevin. Oscar is the s*x and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture..."
22851,Andy,I would agree with that.
22852,Andy,"End the mistakes, easy-"
22853,Andy,I would like that.
22854,Jim,"I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So...my pitch is...me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine."
22855,Darryl,Nahh!  No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
22856,Jim,Is that off again?
22857,Darryl,Ahh...We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
22858,Dwight,"I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it."
22859,Andy,What do you got?
22860,Dwight," Allow me. You're going to love this.  Ugh...should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work."
22861,Dwight,Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
22862,Andy,Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
22863,Dwight,"Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead."
22864,Andy,Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
22865,Dwight,I will do my voodoo.
22866,Andy,"Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really."
22867,Andy,"And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight..."
22868,Dwight,The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
22869,Andy,"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper."
22870,Dwight,Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
22871,Dwight,"Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly."
22872,Dwight,P.S. We should should kill him.
22873,Jim,"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?"
22874,Dwight,"No, it's an accountability booster."
22875,Jim,Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
22876,Dwight,"Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task."
22877,Ryan,We can't do this Dwight.
22878,Dwight,Smile...nod. Smile and nod.
22879,Dwight,"They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like...not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor..."
22880,Andy,"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes."
22881,Dwight,"But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve."
22882,Andy,"Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha."
22883,Oscar,There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
22884,Dwight," Oh, there's one mistake."
22885,Erin,Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
22886,Andy,Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I...
22887,Dwight,"It's not a doomsday device, gosh.  We can do this you guys."
22888,Darryl,It's not a race.
22889,Darryl,Who knows what the belt is for?
22890,Darryl,"Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone."
22891,Darryl,All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
22892,Angela,"Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project."
22893,Kevin,"Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made."
22894,Angela,"Oscar, use a calculator. "
22895,Oscar,"When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. "
22896,Andy,"Alright everybody, you are doing great!"
22897,Dwight,"Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. "
22898,Jim,If this doomsday device goes off...
22899,Jim,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
22900,Dwight,I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
22901,Ryan,"Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like...z64$8.  Not that exactly Jim, something like that."
22902,Dwight,"No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha...You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike."
22903,Darryl,"Once you read the packet, sign the back."
22904,Darryl,"Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back."
22905,Darryl,Mmhmm.  Caramel soy latte.
22906,Angela,You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
22907,Oscar,Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
22908,Kevin,What does this mean? What does it mean!
22909,Andy,Gahhh. That's five strikes.
22910,Andy,Dwight we got five strikes.
22911,Andy,Did the email go out or...
22912,Dwight,It goes out automatically at five P.M.
22913,Andy,"Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it."
22914,Dwight,"Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it."
22915,Andy,Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
22916,Dwight,You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
22917,Dwight,"No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine.  What?!"
22918,Erin,"You're a real crumb bum, you know that?"
22919,Dwight,"Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?"
22920,Kevin,"Uh, the man tree puts its penis-"
22921,Dwight,"Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please."
22922,Oscar,Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
22923,Dwight,Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
22924,Erin,Dwight's car is gone.
22925,Pam,I bet he went home.
22926,Andy,Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
22927,Andy,"Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us."
22928,Andy,Kevin has that lovability.
22929,Kevin,Guys come on. I'm right here.
22930,Andy,"Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something."
22931,Jim,"Ok, where is he?"
22932,Erin,"Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash."
22933,Dwight, Oh. Come to reason with me?
22934,Andy,"Gotcha something.  And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-"
22935,Andy,"Well now hold on it, it-"
22936,Pam,What are you doing?
22937,Dwight,What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
22938,Erin,Do you need a hand?
22939,Pam,"Yeah, do you need a hand? "
22940,Dwight,"If you hit another horse, you've dug to far."
22941,Jim,"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting."
22942,Jim,You up for a game?
22943,Jim,Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
22944,Pam,"Are you okay, Kevin? "
22945,Pam,"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water."
22946,Dwight,"Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on."
22947,Pam,"Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is."
22948,Dwight,"This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009."
22949,Darryl,"Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?"
22950,Darryl,Good policy. Sensible. Smart.
22951,Jim,Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.
22952,Oscar,Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
22953,Angela,"Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-"
22954,Oscar,I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
22955,Oscar,It's not that funny.
22956,Erin," Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt."
22957,Pam,"Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?"
22958,Dwight,"Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's ""Nobody's perfect."" Nice stroke, Pam."
22959,Pam,"No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha."
22960,Dwight,"I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny."
22961,Andy,"Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-"
22962,Pam,You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
22963,Dwight,Don't say cow- Ugh.
22964,Andy,What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.
22965,Pam,"Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will."
22966,Andy,"Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning."
22967,Pam,"Hahhh, thanks for everything."
22968,Kevin,"Isn't it supposed to be, ""Drive safely""?"
22969,Jim, Is that my phone?
22970,Jim,"Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright."
22971,Jim,Yes. Right now? Yes.
22972,Jim,"Awww, sorry. Did it break?"
22973,Jim,What kinda iPhone is that?
22974,Jim,Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
22975,Jim,"Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- "
22976,Pam, Dwight stopped the device!
22977,Ryan,Oh!  We still have our jobs.
22978,Dwight,"They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen.  God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?"
22979,Jim,Yeah. That does not feel good.
22980,Andy,In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I'm not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
22981,Andy,Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I'm going to refuse to take it.
22982,Erin,You're not going to take it?
22983,Andy,Just make up a phone call. It's not a real call. Make it up.
22984,Andy,And come and tell me. Doesn't matter what it is.
22985,Erin,You're not going to get it though?
22986,Andy,"I'm not going to take it. And then he's going to be like ""whoa this is a really important meeting""."
22987,Andy,"Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I'll tell you how we can beat it."
22988,Erin,You have a very important call.
22989,Andy,I'm sorry � I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.
22990,Erin,"Are you sure? It's really, really important."
22991,Andy,There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
22992,Erin,Really? Because your mother is dead.
22993,Andy,I don't think she's dead.
22994,Erin,She's dead. She was hit by a bus.
22995,Andy,She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
22996,Erin,This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen.
22997,Dwight,Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
22998,Andy,Yeah. Um line 1?
22999,Darryl,on phone]It's Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
23000,Darryl,Look man this is a bad idea.
23001,Andy,Did she have any last words or?
23002,Darryl,Really? That is messed up man.
23003,Andy,Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
23004,Darryl,You're a bad man Andy Bernard.
23005,Andy,That is so mom.
23006,Darryl,That stuff can come back to get you. It's called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle...
23007,Andy,Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
23008,Pam,How's it going? Everything make sense?
23009,Pam,"Oh no, I'm fine."
23010,Pam,Ok  Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
23011,Pam,I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh I should've mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice because it's impossible to tell I'm so small. But yeah I'm pregnant.  Oh come on!
23012,Ryan,Hey � asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
23013,Pam,Why do you doubt that she's single?
23014,Jim,Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?
23015,Darryl,What are you doing with my lunch?
23016,Andy,I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
23017,Andy,Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
23018,Darryl,I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
23019,Andy,Uh you tell me 
23020,Ryan,So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
23021,Oscar,Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
23022,Pam,It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh?
23023,Oscar,"No, no. Not even."
23024,Pam,I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing.
23025,Oscar,Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
23026,Pam,Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
23027,Pam,Really well thank you all.
23028,Ryan,Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
23029,Dwight,Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
23030,Oscar,In this case yes.
23031,Dwight,No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
23032,Dwight,Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
23033,Andy,Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
23034,Andy," Hey Robert, are we meeting early?"
23035,Andy,Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
23036,Kevin,We're called Kevin and the Zits.
23037,Darryl,That was never agreed upon.
23038,Andy,Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
23039,Kevin,I have a tambourine.
23040,Andy, CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
23041,Kevin,"Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!"
23042,Darryl,"Again, never agreed upon."
23043,Andy,"I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!"
23044,Darryl,"Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?"
23045,Kevin,We all got to go sometime.
23046,Pam,Huh. What about Cathy?
23047,Pam,Yeah. Do you think she's hot?
23048,Pam,"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?"
23049,Jim,"And I'm telling you, I don't."
23050,Pam,You don't find Cathy attractive?
23051,Jim,"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody."
23052,Pam,Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
23053,Jim,"Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? "
23054,Pam,"Yes, because she's hot, right?"
23055,Dwight,"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on."
23056,Pam,"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth."
23057,Pam,"Dwight, am I hot right now?"
23058,Dwight,"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction."
23059,Pam,What about before? Was I attractive before?
23060,Dwight,"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low."
23061,Pam,Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
23062,Dwight,You think Jim's lying?  That's so cute. I know he's lying.
23063,Pam,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
23064,Dwight,Done.  I never touch a pregnant woman.
23065,Pam,"Yep, that's the Dwight I need."
23066,Dwight,"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules."
23067,Dwight,Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
23068,Pam,I think so. Okay.
23069,Dwight,Rule two: we stop at nothing.
23070,Pam,"Well, what does that... is that... okay."
23071,Dwight,Rule three: Don't fall in love.
23072,Dwight,We're gonna bust this guy.
23073,Pam,Honesty is very important to me.
23074,Dwight,So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
23075,Pam,Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
23076,Dwight,None taken. What do you got?
23077,Darryl,Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
23078,Kevin," Dude, you're on TV! You're the sportscaster on channel seven."
23079,Kevin,You do that on TV!
23080,Kevin,"Guys, I've got some instruments right here. "
23081,Darryl,"Hey, why don't you and me play those?"
23082,Kevin,"Yeah? Okay, this is awesome."
23083,Kevin,Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
23084,Pam,"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single."
23085,Jim,"Oh, I stand corrected."
23086,Pam,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
23087,Jim,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets."
23088,Ryan,"Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?"
23089,Jim,Not his mom's car.
23090,Ryan,"Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z."
23091,Pam,I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
23092,Dwight,I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
23093,Pam,Jim's on to me.
23094,Pam,"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it."
23095,Dwight,Just ugly enough to have deniability.
23096,Jim,"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy."
23097,Dwight,"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body."
23098,Dwight,"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there."
23099,Dwight,Psst. We're not here. 
23100,Dwight,"Okay, just shut it."
23101,Pam,Is he puffing out his chest?
23102,Dwight,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken.  Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
23103,Pam,No. Maybe he just said something funny.
23104,Dwight,"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that."
23105,Pam,I think he's just making her laugh.
23106,Dwight,Time for me to find out.
23107,Pam,Why's he making her laugh so much?
23108,Dwight,"Just going to walk over here-  whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! "
23109,Dwight,"I'm fine, I'm totally fine."
23110,Dwight,"Aw, cramp, I'm just- "
23111,Dwight,"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance."
23112,Dwight," Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft pen1s for nothing."
23113,Pam,Why was he making her laugh so much?
23114,Pam,"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second."
23115,Pam,"Oscar, Cathy has a question!"
23116,Pam,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
23117,Jim,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?"
23118,Pam,"Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now."
23119,Dwight,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate."
23120,Pam,"Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do."
23121,Dwight,And she called it nuts?
23122,Darryl,"Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going."
23123,Andy,Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
23124,Kevin,Are you serious? From Star Trek?
23125,Darryl," Hey, you caught some of that?"
23126,Darryl,"What, you don't like the blues?"
23127,Andy,"Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. "
23128,Dwight," Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my pen1s. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs."
23129,Pam,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
23130,Dwight,"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man?  Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?"
23131,Pam,"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?"
23132,Dwight,We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
23133,Dwight," Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten."
23134,Jim,"Okay, Dwight, come on.  You can go first."
23135,Dwight,"Jim, are you serious?"
23136,Jim,"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush."
23137,Andy,Maybe we could switch instruments.
23138,Andy,"'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised."
23139,Darryl,"Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?"
23140,Andy,We had to leave because of creative differences.
23141,Darryl,Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
23142,Kevin,"Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now."
23143,Darryl,"No man, we are."
23144,Dwight,"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?"
23145,Jim,"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time."
23146,Dwight,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
23147,Pam,"Ah, see, was that so hard?"
23148,Jim,I am not lying.
23149,Jim,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?"
23150,Dwight,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?"
23151,Dwight,"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar."
23152,Pam,"Jim, you have high blood pressure."
23153,Dwight,"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her."
23154,Pam,Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?
23155,Jim,"Yeah, but I don't smoke."
23156,Pam,When was the last time you went to the doctor?
23157,Dwight,It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
23158,Pam,"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?"
23159,Jim,"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul."
23160,Dwight,"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man."
23161,Pam,"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor."
23162,Dwight,Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
23163,Pam,Just go home. It doesn't matter.
23164,Dwight,"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush."
23165,Andy,"Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay."
23166,Pam, I'm gonna do it.
23167,Pam,Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
23168,Jim,"Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!"
23169,Pam,"I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary."
23170,Pam,: I'm going into labor!
23171,Pam,I'm going into labor!
23172,Ryan,"Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-"
23173,Pam,I'm going into labor.
23174,Andy,"Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it."
23175,Oscar,"It's not fair, you guys."
23176,Pam,I'm really in labor! This is happening!
23177,Jim,"Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!"
23178,Jim,How do you feel?
23179,Andy," What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there."
23180,Andy,I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
23181,Andy,Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
23182,Erin,It's right here in PA.
23183,Andy," Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-"
23184,Angela,"Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg."
23185,Andy,That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
23186,Dwight,Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
23187,Oscar,Actually it is the northernmost.
23188,Dwight,The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms.  Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
23189,Andy,"Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?"
23190,Ryan,What's the halal option?
23191,Andy,"Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese."
23192,Andy,"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?"
23193,Dwight,Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
23194,Andy,"Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge."
23195,Andy,And one for you.
23196,Andy,"And- oh. You missed your head.  There you go. Phyllis, think fast!"
23197,Andy,"All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War."
23198,Darryl,"You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV."
23199,Andy,"It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it."
23200,Andy,"All right, all right, all right."
23201,Kevin,Not food and stuff.
23202,Kevin,"Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit."
23203,Pam,I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
23204,Kevin,The fire pit is a no-brainer.
23205,Pam,"Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again."
23206,Ryan,"Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon."
23207,Darryl,Shh! Movie's almost over.
23208,Andy,All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
23209,Andy,Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
23210,Darryl,I got Source Code on the way back.
23211,Andy,"Whoa, where you going?"
23212,Jim,"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?"
23213,Andy,"Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists."
23214,Jim,"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour."
23215,Andy,Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
23216,Andy,"After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch."
23217,Erin," Yeah, but I'm confused..."
23218,Dwight,"Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre..."
23219,Dwight,...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
23220,Erin,Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
23221,Dwight,"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.  I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written."
23222,Oscar,"Dwight, what are you telling this girl?"
23223,Oscar,"Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better."
23224,Erin,"Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said."
23225,Dwight,"No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth."
23226,Dwight,"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed."
23227,Oscar,"Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?"
23228,Dwight,"Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-"
23229,Dwight,"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?"
23230,Dwight,Not by a long shot!
23231,Dwight,"No, it was not!"
23232,Dwight,"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?"
23233,Dwight,Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
23234,Dwight,"Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar."
23235,Erin,Get out of here!
23236,Ryan,May I go first?
23237,Ryan,"Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper."
23238,Ryan,"Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-"
23239,Darryl,"That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?"
23240,Dwight,"Excuse me, I got a question for you."
23241,Dwight,Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
23242,Dwight,"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?"
23243,Oscar,I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
23244,Andy,We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
23245,Pam,"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it."
23246,Pam,"Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
23247,Pam,"At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet."
23248,Kevin,"Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So..."
23249,Kevin,"Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'"
23250,Ryan,"Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy."
23251,Kevin,"'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that...  like, forget it."
23252,Jim,"By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?"
23253,Andy,Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
23254,Jim,"Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry."
23255,Andy,Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
23256,Erin,"Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?"
23257,Andy,"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys?  I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars."
23258,Jim,Only two hundred dollars?
23259,Andy,"We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left."
23260,Darryl,"Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man."
23261,Andy,"Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!"
23262,Andy,Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
23263,Jim,Oh wow. So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
23264,Andy,Its... I mean come on.
23265,Andy,Alright fine. You know what � I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me.
23266,Dwight, You said you weren't going to look back.
23267,Kevin,Yes. I am an accountant.
23268,Oscar,Dwight � this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.
23269,Dwight,Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
23270,Oscar,You've heard about it?
23271,Dwight,YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.
23272,Oscar,Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.
23273,Oscar,You're right. There should be a monument to this.
23274,Kevin,Never trust a cookie with a woman's name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They'll just break your heart.
23275,Ryan,Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea.
23276,Ryan,"It's really, really good Robert. Let me explain."
23277,Kevin,No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me.
23278,Kevin,Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
23279,Ryan,You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea.  That is 100 percent your idea.
23280,Andy,You guys came. Where's everyone else?
23281,Darryl,Back at the bus. We were locked out. Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
23282,Andy,Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.
23283,Jim,Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come. I think they're just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.
23284,Andy,Even without an audience you're still at it.
23285,Jim,What are you talking about?
23286,Andy,Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip.
23287,Jim,"Andy � this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It's just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you're our regional manager. And guess what man? You don't have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head. I'm wearing a very pink hat. I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure ""DM does GB"" means something kinda sexual. But guess who's wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That's huge."
23288,Andy,You don't like the hats?
23289,Andy,"They just didn't turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird."
23290,Andy," The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that's good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager. Yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that I think about it."
23291,Dwight," Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning."
23292,Dwight,"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR."
23293,Dwight,Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.
23294,Oscar,Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
23295,Jim,"Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?"
23296,Darryl,Taking a load off huh?
23297,Dwight,No. Putting a load on more like it.
23298,Darryl,Good luck with that.
23299,Dwight,Last thing I need is luck. 
23300,Dwight, Thank you so much. 
23301,Jim, What are you up to? Oops look out! 
23302,Dwight,What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
23303,Dwight,Oh that's real creative.
23304,Jim,You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
23305,Dwight,"I could, but I just don't feel like it loser."
23306,Jim,You know I have to do this.
23307,Jim,I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
23308,Andy,"Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers."
23309,Jim,I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.
23310,Ryan,That's why my foundation � The Dream for a Wish Foundation � is going to put them out of business. They're not going to know what hit them.
23311,Andy,Hey there. It's a pleasure.
23312,Andy,I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up.
23313,Dwight,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock."
23314,Darryl,You don't have to say it if you're doing it.
23315,Dwight, Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
23316,Darryl,Uh weight lifting yeah.
23317,Dwight,Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
23318,Darryl,I'll take a look.
23319,Dwight,Your path from obesity begins right here!
23320,Darryl,"I've been meaning to join a gym.  For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents."
23321,Dwight,"Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash."
23322,Andy,Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
23323,Andy,We will start here at Erinville.
23324,Andy,Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
23325,Erin,Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
23326,Andy,I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
23327,Andy,I'll explore exploring it.
23328,Andy,Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller.  Alright have at it. Let �er rip. What do you hate about this place?
23329,Jim,Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
23330,Dwight,Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
23331,Jim,Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.
23332,Dwight,It's the second easiest job in the world.  Being a mom.
23333,Andy,You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
23334,Andy,Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
23335,Dwight,Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale .
23336,Andy,Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.
23337,Dwight,Ready? What do you think?
23338,Darryl,Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
23339,Dwight,You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke  Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month...
23340,Darryl,Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
23341,Darryl,Make a real gym.
23342,Andy,But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
23343,Andy,Those are fully staffed as well.
23344,Andy,Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
23345,Andy,There are lots of considerations.
23346,Andy,Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
23347,Andy,We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting.  Hang on. Hello?
23348,Andy,Are you taking your med-meds?
23349,Andy,We promised we'd never say goodbye.
23350,Dwight,Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
23351,Oscar,All I need is another gym. As if I don't have enough drama.
23352,Oscar,Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says...
23353,Dwight,That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
23354,Andy," Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away."
23355,Oscar,"Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?"
23356,Kevin,How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
23357,Angela,This is all pathetic.
23358,Andy,"I am not asking, I am ordering."
23359,Oscar,How mean are we talking about?
23360,Andy,"It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable."
23361,Erin,Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
23362,Erin,Well that's a sales desk.
23363,Kevin,"Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know."
23364,Jim,"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing."
23365,Jim,"Oh, wow. So cute."
23366,Oscar,"Yeah, he's in a ladle."
23367,Erin,That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
23368,Oscar,He did it himself.
23369,Oscar,"Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma."
23370,Oscar,It's not that kind of ladle.
23371,Oscar," Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this."
23372,Andy, What is going on?
23373,Andy,"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?"
23374,Andy,Why would you say that?
23375,Andy,"It's not that, exactly."
23376,Andy,"Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that."
23377,Andy,Yes! The dude is an enigma.
23378,Dwight,What do you think you're doing?
23379,Darryl,Getting my sweat on.
23380,Dwight,"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?"
23381,Darryl,"I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill."
23382,Dwight,I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
23383,Darryl,"Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow."
23384,Dwight,Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings?  I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
23385,Dwight,That's what I said.
23386,Darryl,"You know, get it right."
23387,Andy,It just was one of those things-
23388,Andy,"Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, ""in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen."" "
23389,Andy,I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
23390,Andy,"No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there."
23391,Erin,He just rolled out and crawled out.
23392,Jim," Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. "
23393,Jim," Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.  Creed. I was never here, all right?"
23394,Dwight,"This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked."
23395,Darryl,"Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say."
23396,Dwight,"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor."
23397,Darryl,"Okay, I'm not doing that."
23398,Dwight,Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
23399,Andy," No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!"
23400,Jim," I know, I do."
23401,Andy,"Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness."
23402,Jim,I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
23403,Jim,"That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse."
23404,Andy, I think we've got ourselves an answer.
23405,Andy,That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
23406,Jim," I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking."
23407,Jim,Yes. All right. Great. 
23408,Andy,"You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me."
23409,Dwight,"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?"
23410,Darryl,This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
23411,Dwight,"Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!"
23412,Darryl,"Dwight, come back and spot me."
23413,Dwight,"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?"
23414,Darryl,To push this bar up.
23415,Dwight,"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?"
23416,Dwight,What do you want!?!
23417,Darryl,To look good for Val!
23418,Dwight,Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
23419,Andy," Christmas tiiiime is heeeere!  Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true."
23420,Andy,Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
23421,Andy,It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
23422,Jim,I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
23423,Andy,"Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required."
23424,Dwight,What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
23425,Andy,"That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon."
23426,Dwight,Where? Dark side or light side?
23427,Dwight,Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
23428,Andy,"As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront."
23429,Andy,"So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is."
23430,Jim,"She's not your grandmother, is she?"
23431,Andy,"Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?"
23432,Andy,"Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee."
23433,Andy,"Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam."
23434,Erin,"I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home."
23435,Erin,"Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly."
23436,Erin,"That's OK, I don't want you to do that."
23437,Kevin,How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
23438,Andy,"Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up."
23439,Andy,"Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat.  But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps."
23440,Dwight,Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
23441,Andy,It wasn't either of you.
23442,Jim,Kathy wants to leave our clump?
23443,Andy,Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
23444,Dwight,"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. "
23445,Jim,"Ow, What are you doing? "
23446,Andy,Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
23447,Jim,Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
23448,Andy,Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
23449,Andy,"Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person."
23450,Andy,You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
23451,Erin,"Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug.  I'm Erin."
23452,Erin,"Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here."
23453,Andy,"My ex is meeting my s*x....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s...that's just part of it."
23454,Andy,"Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my pen1s.  Hi."
23455,Andy,"Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr."
23456,Andy,"Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist."
23457,Erin,"Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess."
23458,Erin,Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. 
23459,Andy,"Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis."
23460,Darryl,"This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution."
23461,Darryl,"Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about."
23462,Darryl,"Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid."
23463,Darryl,"Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up."
23464,Jim,Ah... I'm gonna s- 
23465,Jim,"Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink."
23466,Erin,"Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it."
23467,Jim," Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye."
23468,Jim,"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me."
23469,Ryan,"But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed... whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do..."
23470,Darryl,I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
23471,Darryl,I thought you'd wear a sweater.
23472,Darryl,"Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you."
23473,Erin," I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie.  and then I want my nap!"
23474,Andy,How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
23475,Andy,Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
23476,Erin, Maybe you should mind your own business.  Just kidding!
23477,Dwight,Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
23478,Dwight,"Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!"
23479,Jim,"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?"
23480,Dwight,Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
23481,Angela,Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
23482,Dwight,Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
23483,Jim,"Nice try, this is ridiculous."
23484,Dwight,Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
23485,Andy,"Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it."
23486,Jim,"Andy, you've gotta be kidding me."
23487,Jim,"OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control..."
23488,Dwight,Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
23489,Angela,No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
23490,Jim," Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up."
23491,Dwight,Come down right away!
23492,Jim,"Uh, I don't know, let me ask.  Uh, were you quilled?"
23493,Dwight,"Yes, I was quilled."
23494,Jim,And what's it's name?
23495,Andy,"What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight."
23496,Erin,"Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK?  And you both have such beautiful hair."
23497,Erin,"I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone."
23498,Erin,"And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss.  Ah!  OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say ""get a drink"". "
23499,Andy,"Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um..."
23500,Andy,"Yeah, uh, excuse me."
23501,Andy,Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
23502,Erin,Every martini has an olive.
23503,Andy,OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
23504,Kevin,"I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk."
23505,Erin,"Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish."
23506,Andy,"That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something."
23507,Erin, It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
23508,Andy,"You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something."
23509,Erin,I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
23510,Andy,"Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back."
23511,Erin,"Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? "
23512,Kevin,"So, there was talk of oatmeal."
23513,Andy,I was too embarrassed! 
23514,Jim,"Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk.  Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?"
23515,Andy,Cici is Jim's daughter.
23516,Jim,"I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though."
23517,Oscar,Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
23518,Andy,I know who did this....Dwight.
23519,Andy,Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
23520,Jim,"Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like..."
23521,Jim,Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
23522,Jim,"I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry."
23523,Dwight,Enough of this garbage.  This is Christmas.  Hi-yah!!!!!  Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
23524,Andy,"You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?"
23525,Andy,Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
23526,Jim,"Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah."
23527,Andy,"No...I don't, hmm, I don't know."
23528,Andy,"By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work."
23529,Jim,Alright. I will definitely do that.
23530,Andy,"Alright, I'll tell Dwight."
23531,Jim,"You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway."
23532,Andy,Christmas miracles do happen.
23533,Jim,Yes. They totally do.
23534,Ryan,"You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses."
23535,Ryan,I'm trying but you need to-
23536,Erin,I would like another alcohol.
23537,Oscar,"What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?"
23538,Erin,And you have any advice or anything?
23539,Erin,...Help me feel better...
23540,Andy,"I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish."
23541,Andy,"OK, bye.  Alright Meredith,"
23542,Andy,"Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed.  and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,"
23543,Andy,"Let's go, let's go."
23544,Andy,What is all that?
23545,Andy,You're a hoarder. My god!
23546,Andy,Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
23547,Dwight," What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?"
23548,Andy,"Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh."
23549,Andy,"Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now."
23550,Andy,I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
23551,Dwight," Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?"
23552,Dwight,"Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?"
23553,Jim,"Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim.  I got nothin'."
23554,Dwight,Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
23555,Oscar,"You really have to say ""oh yeah"" every time you eat a candy bar?"
23556,Kevin,"I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good.  Oh yeah!"
23557,Jim,"All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to."
23558,Andy,It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
23559,Dwight,You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
23560,Erin, Does anyone have a first aid kit?
23561,Darryl,Check out this song I wrote: I'ma love you downstairs tonight... 
23562,Jim,"All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-"
23563,Andy," Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?"
23564,Jim,You can write a book about chairs.
23565,Oscar,"Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-"
23566,Andy," Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? "
23567,Jim,Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
23568,Andy,"I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!"
23569,Angela,"Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?"
23570,Andy,"Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage."
23571,Dwight,"Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine."
23572,Dwight,Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
23573,Dwight,I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
23574,Dwight,Gabe? You don't know?
23575,Dwight,"Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office."
23576,Andy,"Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to ""play ball."" Those were his words."
23577,Oscar,"Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!"
23578,Andy,So make that error!
23579,Kevin,Hey! I can make that error.
23580,Andy,"Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that."
23581,Andy,"It's just, I really need a real accountant on this.  What do you say?"
23582,Oscar,I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
23583,Oscar,"Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!"
23584,Oscar,"It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me."
23585,Andy,You know what? Go. Have fun.
23586,Andy,There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
23587,Jim,Stop right there. I love it.
23588,Andy,I didn't even say what it is.
23589,Andy,"But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase..."
23590,Jim,That's a great idea.
23591,Darryl,That's a great plan.
23592,Andy,Yeah? You like it?
23593,Jim,"All right, good stuff."
23594,Andy,"I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, ""this sounds really stupid."""
23595,Darryl,"You just made a good idea, a great idea."
23596,Andy,There is one problem with this plan.
23597,Andy,"We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this."
23598,Dwight,"Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy."
23599,Dwight,"You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic."
23600,Dwight,But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
23601,Dwight,Still an important position. Still a chief.
23602,Oscar,"I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?"
23603,Andy,"You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you."
23604,Andy,I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
23605,Oscar,And you guys thought this was a good idea?
23606,Jim,I thought it was a fun idea.
23607,Darryl,"There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar."
23608,Andy,"Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?"
23609,Oscar,Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
23610,Oscar,What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? 
23611,Andy,It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything.  Not anything.
23612,Andy,"Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves."
23613,Andy,"All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... "
23614,Jim,There's a table over here.
23615,Andy,"Oh, we got this!"
23616,Kevin,"How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?"
23617,Erin,"Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness."
23618,Dwight, There's no fires within eight miles of here.
23619,Dwight,"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!"
23620,Andy,"Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine."
23621,Ryan,"That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington."
23622,Jim,"Wrong, for so many reasons."
23623,Jim,"Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes."
23624,Andy,"You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen."
23625,Darryl,"Chill, man. This plan is airtight."
23626,Dwight,"So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!"
23627,Dwight,"Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?"
23628,Dwight,What's with the smile?
23629,Dwight,"And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us."
23630,Dwight,Take me to Robert.
23631,Dwight,Take me to his house.
23632,Dwight,You know where it is. Lead me there.
23633,Dwight,"Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go."
23634,Ryan,"Okay, I'm turning it off."
23635,Ryan,I won't look at it.
23636,Ryan,I can't- I can't not touch it.
23637,Ryan,"Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone. "
23638,Andy,"So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no."
23639,Dwight,Which one is it?
23640,Dwight,Robert! Robert California! Robert!
23641,Darryl,"Yeah, we're going to get clobbered."
23642,Erin,"I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl. "
23643,Dwight,"Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, ""table for one?"" How is this possible?"
23644,Dwight,"Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-"
23645,Dwight,"It's a job interview, not a flea market."
23646,Oscar, Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
23647,Kevin,Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
23648,Kevin,"Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one."
23649,Kevin,"Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home."
23650,Dwight,"Oh, ugh.  What is this, a meatball? Really? "
23651,Jim,"It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird."
23652,Dwight,"Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- "
23653,Dwight,"Aw, man.  This is not very clever, Jim."
23654,Dwight, Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
23655,Dwight,That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
23656,Erin," Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear."
23657,Erin,"I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine."
23658,Erin,I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
23659,Andy,Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
23660,Andy,"My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but..."
23661,Jim," Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though."
23662,Oscar,"Oh, who needs a house that size?"
23663,Dwight,Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
23664,Jim,"You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent."
23665,Jim,"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke."
23666,Jim,"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing."
23667,Andy,"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here."
23668,Andy,"Well, please tell Susan we all say hi."
23669,Kevin,"Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? "
23670,Kevin,"Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it."
23671,Kevin,"Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?"
23672,Oscar,"That was you, Kevin."
23673,Erin,"Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever."
23674,Erin,How do you know where I live?
23675,Erin,Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. 
23676,Angela," Oh, it is warm."
23677,Ryan,"Oh, so close. Eighty-one."
23678,Jim,Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
23679,Jim,DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
23680,Jim,"You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine."
23681,Jim,"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way."
23682,Jim,"I bet I should.  That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you."
23683,Andy," Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage."
23684,Andy,Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. 
23685,Erin, Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
23686,Erin,How is everything? How's your car?
23687,Andy,It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
23688,Erin,Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
23689,Andy,"Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes."
23690,Erin,"Oh, like a goodbye trip."
23691,Erin,"I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him."
23692,Darryl,Val. You made it.
23693,Darryl,"Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?"
23694,Andy,"All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath."
23695,Andy,In a minute. In a minute.
23696,Andy,A minute would be cool.
23697,Andy,"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?"
23698,Erin,"Come on, don't you want to play?"
23699,Dwight,"Yeah, you want to play you little hick? "
23700,Angela,Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
23701,Oscar,How many bottles? Three hundred?
23702,Oscar,Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
23703,Ryan,"Robert, you are too kind."
23704,Ryan,"With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me."
23705,Jim,"Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical."
23706,Dwight," You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?"
23707,Erin,"Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous."
23708,Dwight,I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. 
23709,Erin, Is he looking?  Oh. You can stop.
23710,Dwight,"Okay, you can stop."
23711,Erin,"No, no, no, he's not looking."
23712,Dwight,"No, you can stop."
23713,Erin,You can actually stop.
23714,Oscar,"Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?"
23715,Oscar,"Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club."
23716,Darryl," You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it."
23717,Darryl,"Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in."
23718,Darryl,"I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage."
23719,Dwight," Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah..."
23720,Erin,Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
23721,Erin,What is the most romantic possible thing?
23722,Dwight,We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
23723,Erin,"Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you."
23724,Angela,You're in my way!
23725,Erin,"Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all."
23726,Erin,Dang it! What the heck already?
23727,Dwight,"Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!"
23728,Kevin,"I'm right here!  Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath."
23729,Erin,"Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together."
23730,Dwight,I know. I could just bang you right now.
23731,Erin,He's not looking.  Hey!
23732,Jim,To both these bears.
23733,Ryan,To both these bears.
23734,Oscar,To both these bears.
23735,Ryan,"I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema."
23736,Andy,"Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found."
23737,Andy,I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
23738,Andy,"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?"
23739,Andy,"You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund."
23740,Kevin,Okay. Watch my toes. 
23741,Darryl,Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
23742,Kevin,"That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim."
23743,Dwight, Maybe we should take a little break.
23744,Erin,"Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what."
23745,Erin,"Mush, mush, mush! Come on!"
23746,Andy,I cannot believe you're still up!
23747,Erin,I've got this!  Charge! Go! Go! 
23748,Andy," Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-"
23749,Dwight," Erin, did we win?"
23750,Erin,Sure. Sure we did.
23751,Dwight,You're lying. We didn't win.
23752,Erin,"Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest."
23753,Angela,We're in the pool!
23754,Dwight,"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday."
23755,Andy,"Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday."
23756,Dwight,"I know.  But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation."
23757,Dwight,"So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin."
23758,Andy,"Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me."
23759,Dwight,Not what I asked.
23760,Andy,We're done. Erin and I are over.
23761,Dwight,"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With s*x."
23762,Andy,Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
23763,Kevin,"Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! "
23764,Darryl,Cannonball!  Let's do this!
23765,Erin,So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
23766,Andy,Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
23767,Erin,The Bernard family seal. Duh.
23768,Erin,Sorry if your special night was ruined.
23769,Andy,"Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night."
23770,Erin,"Oh, you weren't going to do that?"
23771,Andy,"Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you."
23772,Erin,"Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused."
23773,Jim,"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?"
23774,Ryan,"Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man."
23775,Oscar," Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!"
23776,Jim,And there's my talking point.
23777,Ryan,"Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave."
23778,Andy,"Val, I need the space."
23779,Andy,I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
23780,Andy,Obviously I'm going to clean up.
23781,Andy,"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, ""Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,"" and then you have to be like, ""Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!"" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance.  s*x also works."
23782,Erin,Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
23783,Andy,Hey! Tuna! He's back.
23784,Andy,"Oh, look at this.  Tuna wrap."
23785,Jim,"It was pretty uneventful, actually."
23786,Dwight,Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
23787,Erin,What was the case?
23788,Jim,"Uh, hit and run."
23789,Erin,"Ooh, ""the case of the hit and run,"" that's exciting."
23790,Dwight,"Of course you found him not guilty.  ""Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."""
23791,Jim,"We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come."
23792,Dwight,"Not coming, have plans."
23793,Jim,"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened."
23794,Erin,Ah! Angela had the baby!
23795,Kevin,Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
23796,Darryl,Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
23797,Kevin,"A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up."
23798,Ryan,"Eh, a little bit."
23799,Kevin,"Oh, did I win the pool?"
23800,Erin,"Ah, no. Right month, wrong year."
23801,Oscar,Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
23802,Erin,We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
23803,Jim,"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work."
23804,Oscar,"Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family."
23805,Kevin,"Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom."
23806,Oscar,"We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit."
23807,Andy,"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?"
23808,Jim,"Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-"
23809,Jim,"Wow, I'm really sorry."
23810,Jim,I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
23811,Jim," So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually."
23812,Jim,"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too."
23813,Dwight,"I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants."
23814,Oscar," Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive."
23815,Angela,Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
23816,Oscar,We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
23817,Kevin,Phillip is so fat.
23818,Kevin,"You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby."
23819,Erin,He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
23820,Dwight,"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop..."
23821,Dwight,And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
23822,Dwight,"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle.  Busted, Halpert!"
23823,Dwight,"Yes! Andy, get out here."
23824,Jim,No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
23825,Dwight,I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
23826,Dwight,Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
23827,Andy,"Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory."
23828,Dwight,I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
23829,Andy,"No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill."
23830,Dwight,I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
23831,Andy,"Here, right there.  Down the hatch."
23832,Dwight,I really don't want to take the chill pill. 
23833,Andy,"Attaboy. Good. Now, chill."
23834,Dwight,"Okay, okay.  But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?"
23835,Andy,"Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. "
23836,Dwight,That's good enough for me. 
23837,Jim,"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you."
23838,Andy,I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
23839,Jim,Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
23840,Andy,"No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?"
23841,Andy,Do you know why you never heard of it?
23842,Jim,Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
23843,Andy,They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
23844,Andy,"My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt."
23845,Dwight,"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. "
23846,Dwight,"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?"
23847,Dwight,"No, Toby!  Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you.  Ask him if he remembers Jim. "
23848,Dwight,"He says, ""No!"" Boom!"
23849,Andy,"Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients."
23850,Dwight,"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. "
23851,Jim,"Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them."
23852,Dwight,"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?"
23853,Andy,Why? Everybody's heard it.
23854,Dwight,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
23855,Andy,"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there."
23856,Jim,Because my car broke down.
23857,Andy,"His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse."
23858,Dwight,"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?"
23859,Andy,"Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that."
23860,Andy,We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
23861,Jim,"Well, I think you handled it pretty well."
23862,Andy,"I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your ."
23863,Jim,"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth."
23864,Andy, I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
23865,Oscar,"Wow, it's so... healthy."
23866,Kevin,I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
23867,Angela,"No, you will not."
23868,Erin,Is he really five pounds?
23869,Erin,"Because I squat with five pounds. This-  yeah, this feels like more than that."
23870,Angela,"Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?"
23871,Oscar,"Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-"
23872,Oscar,"Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-"
23873,Angela,"No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you."
23874,Kevin,I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
23875,Oscar,This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
23876,Jim,"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off."
23877,Jim,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
23878,Dwight," You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening."
23879,Jim,"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good."
23880,Dwight,Your clients. They're all mine.
23881,Darryl,"Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse."
23882,Andy,"Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die."
23883,Dwight,"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand.  Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. "
23884,Andy,"Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim."
23885,Dwight,"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-"
23886,Andy,"I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. "
23887,Dwight,That's it? This is crap! 
23888,Dwight,"Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP."
23889,Dwight,"I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle."
23890,Oscar,"Honestly, I can return this for a larger size."
23891,Angela,"It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio."
23892,Oscar,The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
23893,Angela,"Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago."
23894,Oscar,"I knew that, I knew it."
23895,Angela,"The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata."
23896,Angela,"Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock."
23897,Angela,"And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious."
23898,Dwight,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?"
23899,Oscar,"He went to the car or something, but he'll be back."
23900,Oscar,Don't you want to see the baby?
23901,Dwight,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
23902,Oscar,I promised I wouldn't tell.
23903,Oscar,Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
23904,Oscar,She got pregnant before the wedding.
23905,Oscar,A month.  You didn't hear it from me!
23906,Dwight,I want to see the baby.
23907,Erin,"Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it."
23908,Dwight,"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions...  willingly, or as slaves."
23909,Dwight,"That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose s*x, that baby is mine."
23910,Angela,"No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover."
23911,Jim, You want a giraffe?
23912,Jim,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam."
23913,Pam,"Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here."
23914,Jim,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face."
23915,Pam,"Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!"
23916,Jim,"Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think."
23917,Pam,How about a little visit?
23918,Jim,"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers."
23919,Pam,"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip."
23920,Andy,"Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does."
23921,Pam,"No, it's the pacifier's turn."
23922,Jim,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
23923,Pam," Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat."
23924,Pam,"No, but that would've been a really good idea."
23925,Jim,That was a great idea.
23926,Pam,"No, she brought you drawings."
23927,Jim,"Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy."
23928,Andy,"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?"
23929,Pam,"She says ""no"" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is ""No."" Cece, do you want some broccoli?"
23930,Ryan,Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
23931,Andy,There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
23932,Andy,"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?"
23933,Jim,"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?"
23934,Jim,I don't know what else we can do here.
23935,Pam,"Oh, it's okay, sweetie."
23936,Jim,"All right, all right. Okay."
23937,Pam,"It's okay, honey.  It's okay, it's okay."
23938,Jim,"All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this."
23939,Dwight,"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me."
23940,Angela,Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
23941,Dwight,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
23942,Angela,That is completely untrue.
23943,Dwight,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
23944,Dwight,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
23945,Angela,I did not. Uh-uh.
23946,Dwight,"-and I said, ""I bet I could fulfill you,"" and you said, ""I'd like to see you try,"" and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls."
23947,Dwight,And then I inserted my penis-
23948,Angela,"And even if it did, it's just a coincidence."
23949,Dwight,Admit that there is a chance.
23950,Dwight,Admit it. Admit it.
23951,Angela,"I will not, it's not-"
23952,Angela,"Yes, yes. He's sleeping."
23953,Dwight,"Before I go, may I?"
23954,Angela,"Sure.  Watch the head, watch the head."
23955,Dwight,"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision."
23956,Dwight,I just might be his father.
23957,Jim," I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?"
23958,Jim,"Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?"
23959,Pam,"I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier."
23960,Jim,"Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud."
23961,Jim,"I know, I know."
23962,Pam,You want to grab her?
23963,Jim,"I'm gonna grab her, okay."
23964,Pam,"Here we go, here we go."
23965,Jim,"Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up."
23966,Jim,"No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back."
23967,Darryl,"It's all good, we got this."
23968,Darryl,"I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation."
23969,Andy,"Hey, we'll be just fine."
23970,Jim,"Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go."
23971,Andy,"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here."
23972,Dwight,"Oh, right.  The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe."
23973,Dwight,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant."
23974,Dwight,"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?"
23975,Jim,Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
23976,Andy,Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant.  Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
23977,Pam,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three."
23978,Pam," Well, it's not exactly a vacation."
23979,Angela,Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
23980,Dwight,What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
23981,Angela,I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. 
23982,Oscar,"Angela, you look amazing."
23983,Angela,"Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars."
23984,Pam,"Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?"
23985,Kevin,"Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it."
23986,Pam,Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
23987,Angela,"I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here."
23988,Pam,When did you find time to do all this?
23989,Angela,"Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?"
23990,Pam,Thank you.  Oh my gosh. It's really good.
23991,Angela,"I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh."
23992,Pam,"So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-"
23993,Pam,...we wanted to say thank you-
23994,Andy,"Dwight, I have exciting news for you."
23995,Andy,I think you're going to like it.
23996,Dwight,You can't tantalize me.
23997,Andy,"Oooh, maybe I can.  I got an email... from corporate....that told me that..."
23998,Andy,That... you got a promotion!  Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
23999,Dwight,"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear."
24000,Andy,"No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores."
24001,Dwight,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!"
24002,Dwight,"The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ""perfect pork anus"" which I don't mean."
24003,Erin,And here's the fax for you.
24004,Andy,And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
24005,Erin,Ah! Love to learn.
24006,Andy,"Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one."
24007,Andy,"Uh yeah, look at that."
24008,Andy,"Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later."
24009,Erin,Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. 
24010,Erin,"For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica."
24011,Darryl,What do we have here?
24012,Darryl,"Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a ""we're just friends"" beanie or a ""I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'"" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie."
24013,Dwight,"Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks."
24014,Pam,I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
24015,Dwight,"Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill."
24016,Pam,Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
24017,Dwight,"God, you're such a spy."
24018,Darryl, Notice anything different about me?
24019,Darryl,Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
24020,Darryl, Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
24021,Darryl,"Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here."
24022,Darryl,"No, no, no. Maybe just later."
24023,Darryl,Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
24024,Dwight,"My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?"
24025,Jim,"I just got a text from Robert California that says ""bring your clubs to Florida""."
24026,Pam,Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
24027,Jim,I hope not.  Because I am not going. Two question marks?
24028,Pam,"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one."
24029,Andy,"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?"
24030,Andy,Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
24031,Andy,"They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find."
24032,Dwight,Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
24033,Andy,"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin."
24034,Andy,You have your team.
24035,Dwight,Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
24036,Pam,"Well, let's hear it."
24037,Jim,"""Robert, Hey!"" Exclamation point."
24038,Pam,I like it so far.
24039,Jim,"""Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA"" Dash JH."
24040,Pam,"It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida."
24041,Jim,"Yeah, it's a golf text."
24042,Pam,Total golf text. Send it.
24043,Jim,Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
24044,Darryl,Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
24045,Darryl,We're friends. We're friends.
24046,Darryl,"Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen."
24047,Darryl,Back off! I got my reasons.
24048,Dwight,"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?"
24049,Dwight,"Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida."
24050,Dwight,"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you."
24051,Oscar,It just feels like a slap in the face.
24052,Dwight,"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons."
24053,Oscar,We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
24054,Dwight,"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime."
24055,Kevin,"Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape."
24056,Dwight,"Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan."
24057,Ryan,What are the criteria for going?
24058,Dwight,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out.  Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you."
24059,Dwight,"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?"
24060,Andy,Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
24061,Angela,"Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office."
24062,Angela,My baby is not a monster!
24063,Dwight,Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
24064,Andy,"Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!"
24065,Ryan,"Stop calling us ""guys""."
24066,Andy,"I use the word ""guys"" a lot when I'm nervous...guys."
24067,Ryan,Stop. Stop it Andy.
24068,Andy,Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
24069,Dwight,OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
24070,Andy,"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out."
24071,Dwight,"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it."
24072,Andy,No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
24073,Andy,Five to six hours?
24074,Dwight,Three to four hours.
24075,Andy,No no no no.
24076,Dwight,Two to three hours...
24077,Dwight,Come up with a statement in the next hour....
24078,Pam,"Ok, read it back to me."
24079,Jim," Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets."
24080,Pam,Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
24081,Erin,Absolutely. Works for me.
24082,Pam,Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
24083,Jim,Really did  He responded L-O-L.
24084,Dwight,"I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving."
24085,Ryan,"You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there."
24086,Ryan,"Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks."
24087,Andy,Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
24088,Dwight,"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat."
24089,Kevin,"Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something..."
24090,Dwight,"Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know."
24091,Kevin,When do we leave?
24092,Dwight,"Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby."
24093,Andy,"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?"
24094,Dwight,Maybe it's what she does here...
24095,Erin,"Hey guys, any spots left?"
24096,Andy,"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?"
24097,Erin,I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
24098,Dwight,You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
24099,Erin,"Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go."
24100,Andy,Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
24101,Erin,"Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good."
24102,Jim,"Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?"
24103,Pam,I think you need to go to Florida.
24104,Jim,I think you're right.
24105,Pam,"It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.."
24106,Pam,I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
24107,Jim,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone."
24108,Dwight,"Well,  No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?"
24109,Andy,"Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go."
24110,Dwight,I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
24111,Jim,"You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go."
24112,Dwight,Jim is essential to th-
24113,Jim,"Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. "
24114,Dwight,"Andy, Jim is just too...essen-..."
24115,Dwight,This is stupid! Cut.
24116,Jim,"Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks."
24117,Dwight,He doesn't even want to go.
24118,Jim,"Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates."
24119,Jim,"Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water."
24120,Andy,"OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy.."
24121,Dwight,"You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team.  AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!"
24122,Dwight,"Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move."
24123,Dwight,"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead."
24124,Dwight,"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?"
24125,Ryan,"No no, I want to go."
24126,Dwight,"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. "
24127,Jim,Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
24128,Dwight,"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it."
24129,Dwight,How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
24130,Dwight,"I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. "
24131,Dwight,"Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ""I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt"" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-,  oh. What was that?"
24132,Darryl,Hey what's up? You called?
24133,Darryl,"""This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack"""
24134,Darryl,Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
24135,Darryl,"She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?"
24136,Darryl,Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
24137,Dwight,"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene."
24138,Erin,I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
24139,Dwight,So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
24140,Jim,"So, what is this special project?"
24141,Dwight,Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
24142,Dwight,"It did, it did."
24143,Ryan,You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
24144,Erin,"Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.  Oh, don't write it down unless you like it."
24145,Dwight,"Oh, I like it."
24146,Ryan,It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
24147,Dwight,No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
24148,Ryan,"Right. Think different, from Apple."
24149,Jim,"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?"
24150,Dwight, Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
24151,Dwight,"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag."
24152,Ryan,"Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there."
24153,Ryan,"No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair."
24154,Pam,Bye. Call me when you land.
24155,Erin,Goodbye for a very very long time.
24156,Andy,"Oh, K. It's only three weeks."
24157,Dwight,"Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late."
24158,Dwight,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up!  Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?"
24159,Erin,Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
24160,Dwight,"Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!"
24161,Erin,"Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! "
24162,Erin,"Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now."
24163,Ryan,"Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine.  Oh, not cool!"
24164,Jim,"I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- "
24165,Dwight,Heeeere's Dwi- what the-?  Oh man.
24166,Erin,What do you think happened?
24167,Dwight,"Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples.  Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. "
24168,Jim,Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
24169,Dwight,"Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan."
24170,Dwight,"I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her."
24171,Dwight,"I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel."
24172,Ryan,"Okay, and this one is, ""Huh. Don't see too many museums around here."""
24173,Dwight,"Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car."
24174,Erin,"Hey, are you okay?"
24175,Dwight,"I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming."
24176,Erin,Who says none of us are diarrheal?
24177,Jim,Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
24178,Jim,"Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, ""For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?"" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?"
24179,Dwight,I'm gonna set your face on fire.
24180,Jim,"That's a good one.  Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?"
24181,Andy,Ahh!  Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
24182,Andy,"It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin...  I thought that would be cooler."
24183,Andy,"Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it."
24184,Oscar,Can we see that? Did you really find it?
24185,Andy,"Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow.  In the trash."
24186,Pam,"Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail."
24187,Andy,Oh! There we go! Pam?
24188,Andy,Can you get the phone?
24189,Pam,Well I'm not the receptionist.
24190,Andy,"Mm, well, you used to be."
24191,Pam,"I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do."
24192,Andy,"Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin.  Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?"
24193,Jim,Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
24194,Jim,I would love to hear the other mottos.
24195,Ryan,"So who's leading this thing, anyway?"
24196,Ryan,I can't wait to meet him.
24197,Jim,You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
24198,Dwight,"You didn't poison me, it's just stress."
24199,Dwight,What is the antidote?
24200,Dwight,"I'll do it! I always say, ""You want something done right? Ask Dwight."" Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. "
24201,Dwight,Mmm!  There we go.
24202,Dwight," Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on.  What kind of poison did you use?"
24203,Jim,"Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding."
24204,Dwight,"Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone.  Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed."
24205,Dwight,"Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot."
24206,Dwight,You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
24207,Dwight,"I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter."
24208,Dwight,"Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!"
24209,Jim,Wow. Are you that bored?
24210,Jim,Is that another motto?
24211,Jim,"Ah, let's do it.  Oh, that's healthy."
24212,Jim,"I've spent so much of my life telling myself ""Please, don't end up like Stanley,"" and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes."
24213,Erin,"Jim, are you in?"
24214,Jim,"Oh, I don't know."
24215,Jim,"All right, what the heck? Let's do it."
24216,Dwight,I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
24217,Ryan,"Dude, I think you have appendicitis."
24218,Jim,"Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?"
24219,Dwight,"Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!"
24220,Dwight,Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
24221,Jim,"Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning."
24222,Jim,"The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty."
24223,Ryan,Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
24224,Erin,How long will he be gone?
24225,Dwight,Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
24226,Dwight," Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you.  Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up."
24227,Pam,"Whoa, are those mini pizzas?"
24228,Andy,"Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck."
24229,Kevin,"Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge?  Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge."
24230,Andy,"Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through."
24231,Andy,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy.  I put out some new magazines, check it out."
24232,Andy,"I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks.  Oh, there's the phone!"
24233,Dwight,I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
24234,Erin,"Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later."
24235,Dwight,Who's doing the presentations?
24236,Erin,"Packer's giving one.  Jim'll probably give ours, I guess."
24237,Erin,"Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-"
24238,Dwight,"Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting."
24239,Dwight,I'm great. How are you?
24240,Dwight,What's our presentation about?
24241,Jim,"Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours."
24242,Dwight,"I got the surgery, what else is there to do?"
24243,Erin,Do a hundred jumping jacks.
24244,Dwight,"No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks."
24245,Erin,I don't feel like it either!
24246,Dwight,I want that vice-presidency.
24247,Jim,You haven't done any of the research.
24248,Dwight,"""You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name."" You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it."
24249,Jim,"Stanley, are you listening to music?"
24250,Dwight,"All right, who's ready for the next presentation?"
24251,Dwight,"What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is."
24252,Dwight,"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is...  The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do.  Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay."
24253,Dwight,Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
24254,Ryan,I can field this one.
24255,Dwight,"No, sit down. ""Seasonal."" Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.  Thank you.  Oh, God. Next slide."
24256,Andy,"Mail call!  His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt."
24257,Kevin,Are those the lyrics?
24258,Dwight,Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
24259,Dwight,"Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters."
24260,Dwight,Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
24261,Jim,You are bleeding through your shirt.
24262,Dwight,Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face.  Ah.
24263,Andy,"Yes I am, as a matter of fact."
24264,Pam,"Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?"
24265,Andy,I found my calling.
24266,Darryl,"Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog."
24267,Pam,"Guys, I don't like this analogy."
24268,Andy, Ugh! Fine. Did you see this? 
24269,Dwight,"Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle."
24270,Dwight,"You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass."
24271,Dwight,Ah! Not so fast.
24272,Dwight,I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
24273,Dwight,"I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix."
24274,Andy," Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew."
24275,Andy,"Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks."
24276,Andy,I miss her too.
24277,Erin,"Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-"
24278,Erin,I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
24279,Pam,"Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?"
24280,Oscar,"Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do."
24281,Pam,Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
24282,Angela,"News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid."
24283,Pam,"Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course."
24284,Angela,That is where we disagree.
24285,Oscar,"Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?"
24286,Pam,"No, three-month-old humans don't do that."
24287,Angela,My Phillip is crawling.
24288,Pam,Angela is such a liar!
24289,Oscar,"Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long."
24290,Pam,"Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again."
24291,Angela,"No one said ""you must have two"""
24292,Oscar,"Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no."
24293,Andy, Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat...am i right?
24294,Dwight," That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP."
24295,Dwight,"Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-"
24296,Dwight,"That's a hobby, unless it's for food."
24297,Dwight,That's just a verb.
24298,Dwight,"Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks."
24299,Dwight,"English peoples' main use today is judging American talent.  You're crap. You're wonderful.  They're mean, but they're incisive."
24300,Jim,"Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal.  I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon."
24301,Andy,"Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!"
24302,Pam,"Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!"
24303,Pam,We are good to goooo!
24304,Pam,We're good to goooo!
24305,Andy,Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
24306,Pam,"Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball."
24307,Andy,"...ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor."
24308,Dwight,Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ... What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
24309,Dwight,"That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback."
24310,Dwight,"Oh, you get kicked."
24311,Jim,How many buttons do you have?
24312,Dwight,(takes out bag) 40. Always.
24313,Dwight,Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
24314,Dwight,"No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you."
24315,Jim,College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
24316,Ryan,"I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please."
24317,Erin,And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
24318,Erin,"Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it."
24319,Erin,A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
24320,Erin,"I'm moving down here, you know."
24321,Ryan,"Oh, no, I didn't know."
24322,Erin,"I'm young, and I can ... and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young."
24323,Ryan,You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
24324,Ryan,"Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey."
24325,Pam,Watson carpet and tile.
24326,Oscar,Order reference number 00983-126.
24327,Dwight,Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
24328,Dwight,"Well, saddles...  ... sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth."
24329,Dwight,"If anyone's having s*x with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off."
24330,Andy,"Who is ready for dinner? ""oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid"". No.  I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves...   A Jamaican feast, mon!"
24331,Andy,"Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!"
24332,Oscar,"Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff."
24333,Darryl,What's up man? I'm Darryl.
24334,Kevin,"Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!"
24335,Darryl,I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
24336,Andy,"Heyyy... let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!"
24337,Jim,"Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening."
24338,Jim,"Hey, how's it going?"
24339,Jim,"Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball."
24340,Jim,"Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in... March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so... "
24341,Jim,"Yes, nice. Good word association"
24342,Dwight,"Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it "
24343,Andy,"I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something."
24344,Kevin,It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery...
24345,Andy,"Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?"
24346,Jim,"Yup, coming.  All right."
24347,Jim,Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
24348,Jim,"No, no, no, Stanley."
24349,Jim,Stanley. Uhh... you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
24350,Erin,Whoa. the lights are still on.
24351,Ryan,"Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off."
24352,Erin,I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
24353,Ryan,"Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me."
24354,Ryan,"Hello, what do we have here?"
24355,Erin,"Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl..."
24356,Erin,... a measuring cup...
24357,Ryan,Got that.  Get down.
24358,Ryan," Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please."
24359,Darryl,"""I got too much ice cream. You want some?"" ""Getting' my fry on."""
24360,Darryl,"Uh, ""The moon is huge tonight."""
24361,Darryl,That's regular text talk.
24362,Darryl,"""You're such a great friend."""
24363,Darryl,"""You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot."""
24364,Darryl,"Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here."
24365,Dwight,"You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree?  ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy."
24366,Jim," I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt."
24367,Dwight,"Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor."
24368,Dwight,I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
24369,Dwight,You really want Packer as your boss?
24370,Dwight,"If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses."
24371,Dwight,Where did you see it?
24372,Dwight,We gotta find it before it eggs. 
24373,Jim,"Brown, shiny, painful bite."
24374,Dwight,Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
24375,Jim,"Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation."
24376,Dwight,"Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?"
24377,Jim,"So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this."
24378,Dwight,Pshh. That's a bedbug.
24379,Dwight,"God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this."
24380,Dwight,"You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide  I am going to generate myself into a human trap.  When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. "
24381,Jim,He knows what he's doing.
24382,Dwight,Let the bedbugs bite!
24383,Jim,"Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?"
24384,Dwight,We wait.  Come to papa.
24385,Jim,"I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again."
24386,Dwight,"Nope, I wasn't bitten."
24387,Jim,"Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here."
24388,Dwight,"Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect."
24389,Dwight,"If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me."
24390,Jim,You know what? Maybe they just ate.
24391,Dwight,"No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long."
24392,Jim,"Okay, they're fine. They're adults."
24393,Dwight,"No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first."
24394,Jim,Is that really how you want to get this job?
24395,Dwight,Such a chorus girl.
24396,Jim,"Okay, Dwight... Dwight... Dwight, Dwight Dwight!... uh..."
24397,Dwight,"Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey."
24398,Jim,"Okay alright.  I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married."
24399,Jim,"I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching."
24400,Jim,"Yes, I can.  uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care."
24401,Pam,"Hey, Darryl. You okay?"
24402,Darryl,She's got a boyfriend.
24403,Andy,"Play it cool, man. She'll come around."
24404,Pam,"No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there."
24405,Andy,"Yeah, but... My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool."
24406,Pam,My husband would tell you to go for it.
24407,Ryan,"Hey, this is fun."
24408,Erin,A lot of fun.
24409,Ryan,"I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day."
24410,Erin,You should move down here with me.
24411,Erin,We could be roommates.
24412,Erin,"We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-"
24413,Erin,Maybe in six months-
24414,Ryan," Six months?... um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly."
24415,Dwight,"Okay... Seven, one, one, nine..."
24416,Dwight,"Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?"
24417,Dwight,"Seven minutes. ... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. . "
24418,Dwight," Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past."
24419,Darryl,It has been processed.
24420,Pam,"That's it, last one."
24421,Andy,Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee...
24422,Andy,I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion...
24423,Darryl,"Hey, just so you know, me and you... I don't think that's ridiculous... Dot, dot, dot... dot, dot."
24424,Jim,All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
24425,Dwight, It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
24426,Jim," Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!"
24427,Dwight,I think I saw it!
24428,Jim,"Nice job, I think you got 'em."
24429,Dwight,"You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy."
24430,Dwight,Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
24431,Jim,Oh yeah? What's the first best?
24432,Dwight,"Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR  and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine."
24433,Ryan,Are you holding this chair?
24434,Ryan,�cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off.
24435,Ryan,I'm not wearing the right shoes for this.
24436,Dwight,"We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots."
24437,Erin,Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
24438,Erin,"Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It's me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me."
24439,Dwight,"Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core."
24440,Dwight,"Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much."
24441,Dwight,"Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing � bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love �em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?"
24442,Ryan,"When people see this presentation, they're gonna  in their pants."
24443,Dwight,"Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers."
24444,Dwight,"Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid."
24445,Dwight,"Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!"
24446,Kevin,"Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?"
24447,Andy,Don't care. Tell me later.
24448,Kevin,"Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this."
24449,Andy,What do you got?
24450,Andy,"Yes, I do. Phyllis."
24451,Kevin,I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
24452,Kevin,It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car.
24453,Darryl,"Andy, who punched you?"
24454,Andy,"Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam..."
24455,Andy,"They had, uh... weapons."
24456,Andy,I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
24457,Pam,But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
24458,Andy,"Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime."
24459,Pam,Thank goodness he was there.
24460,Andy,I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.
24461,Dwight,Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
24462,Dwight,"There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir."
24463,Erin,I was ahead of you!
24464,Dwight,"Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids."
24465,Erin,Come on. I was in line before you.
24466,Erin,"Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing... zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun."
24467,Oscar,How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
24468,Andy,"No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?"
24469,Pam,Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
24470,Andy,"And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area."
24471,Angela,Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
24472,Andy,Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
24473,Darryl,"Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7."
24474,Andy,"Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why... Toby is giving us self defense training."
24475,Andy,Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
24476,Jim," Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?"
24477,Jim,"Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay."
24478,Dwight,"Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing."
24479,Dwight,Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
24480,Jim,"I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?"
24481,Dwight,"You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do."
24482,Dwight,"Point it towards the store, idiot!"
24483,Dwight, You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
24484,Dwight,"Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!"
24485,Erin,We are closed! Come on.
24486,Andy,What if you're being attacked by a ... smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
24487,Andy,"What if you're being attacked by a 4'11"" man who is penisless?"
24488,Oscar,Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
24489,Andy,"Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man."
24490,Andy,"So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?"
24491,Angela,Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
24492,Dwight,"Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine."
24493,Dwight,"But you still work for Wired, right?"
24494,Dwight,Good! Okay. Flirt away.
24495,Ryan,Sabre. It's time to come home.
24496,Jim,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous."
24497,Ryan,"Yeah, no , Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?"
24498,Dwight,"Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen."
24499,Dwight,You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
24500,Dwight,I'm trying to make him feel important.
24501,Ryan,God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
24502,Dwight,"Um...  Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee."
24503,Ryan,You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
24504,Ryan,"On my God. You're so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though."
24505,Jim, You can...  You can do it Ryan.
24506,Ryan,And you know that I'm capable of this.
24507,Jim,"You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie."
24508,Ryan,What did you think of the presentation?
24509,Jim,"I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --"
24510,Ryan,"Oh! ""Fix"" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!"
24511,Dwight,"Jim, get him a water."
24512,Ryan,"No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!"
24513,Dwight,Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
24514,Andy, I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
24515,Oscar,You've gotta be kidding me.
24516,Kevin,"Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?"
24517,Pam,I just had a baby.
24518,Pam,How �bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
24519,Andy," Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day."
24520,Darryl,"Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop."
24521,Dwight,Have you seen Erin?
24522,Dwight,Oh God...  Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
24523,Dwight,It's moments away. Just stay here!
24524,Ryan," Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife?  Well, that doesn't make any sense to me."
24525,Ryan,"Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is... "
24526,Erin,"Sorry about kicking you out. It's just, we don't want our brand associated with death."
24527,Erin,You're not married yet?
24528,Erin,"My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends."
24529,Erin,Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
24530,Dwight,How long has he been in the bathroom?
24531,Dwight,Jeez! What's he doing in there? 
24532,Jim,"Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?"
24533,Dwight,Are there any bloggers around?
24534,Jim,"It's Ryan. ""I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home."""
24535,Dwight,"I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!"
24536,Dwight,That's right. Will you just give us a second?
24537,Jim,I'm not doing the Presentation.
24538,Dwight,"Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this,  I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim."
24539,Jim,"Okay, I'll do it."
24540,Dwight,"Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes."
24541,Dwight,"Of course there's a costume!   Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation."
24542,Dwight,Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
24543,Jim,I've been in here for 20 seconds.
24544,Dwight,Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
24545,Jim,I'm not wearing eyeliner.
24546,Dwight,"You are wearing eyeliner, Jim."
24547,Jim,"Time. Space. Gender.  There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it.  No, that's --"
24548,Jim,"This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. "
24549,Jim,"When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me.  I just wanted... to go home.  This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013.  You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space."
24550,Ryan, Sabre... It's time... to come home.
24551,Jim,All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! 
24552,Jim,Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you.
24553,Kevin,"Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity."
24554,Angela,Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
24555,Oscar,With all due respect we know what we're defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
24556,Angela,Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
24557,Andy,"Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!"
24558,Pam," Oh boy. Oh no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning."
24559,Andy,"You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby.  I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, ""Where were you when the girls came?"""
24560,Andy,"Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good!"
24561,Dwight,"Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation."
24562,Dwight,"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!"
24563,Andy," Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us."
24564,Andy,"He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever."
24565,Andy,Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
24566,Angela,"Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead."
24567,Andy,How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke  of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
24568,Oscar,"You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. "
24569,Oscar,"When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure.  Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there.  Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride."
24570,Andy,I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. 
24571,Oscar,I am dying to know what's in there.
24572,Andy,"Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. "
24573,Andy," Now, carefully... open the box."
24574,Pam,"Aw, that's so sweet! "
24575,Dwight," A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!"
24576,Dwight," Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! "
24577,Dwight, You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. 
24578,Jim,"Oh, that reminds me.  Little something from all of us. "
24579,Dwight," Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful.  Four!  Oh yeah!"
24580,Jim,"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah."
24581,Darryl," Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?"
24582,Andy,"Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice."
24583,Darryl,I'll put you down for shortbreads.
24584,Darryl,I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
24585,Darryl,"You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting."
24586,Darryl," All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some.  When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin."
24587,Erin," Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo."
24588,Erin," I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred."
24589,Erin,"Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her.  I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me."
24590,Erin,"Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. "
24591,Erin,"Oh, I boiled some Gatorade."
24592,Darryl, Would you like to buy some cookies?
24593,Kevin," Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth."
24594,Darryl," It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev."
24595,Kevin,I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
24596,Darryl,"You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport."
24597,Darryl,"That doesn't mean anything.  Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?"
24598,Kevin,"Oh, I definitely do."
24599,Darryl," Huh. Hit the road, jack."
24600,Kevin," Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me."
24601,Kevin,"No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed."
24602,Kevin,Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. 
24603,Jim, All right. So... I guess this is it.
24604,Dwight,"Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win."
24605,Dwight," Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! "
24606,Jim,"Well, he's Florida's problem now."
24607,Jim,I thought you liked the store?
24608,Jim,"Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible."
24609,Dwight," Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!"
24610,Dwight," The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre   to the power of two."
24611,Dwight,"You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper."
24612,Jim, All right. There he is.
24613,Dwight,What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
24614,Jim,Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
24615,Dwight,"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? "
24616,Jim,"Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- "
24617,Dwight,"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. "
24618,Dwight," I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it.  But your face does look like the guy from Operation."
24619,Jim,"You know, I just think you should know that-"
24620,Dwight, That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. 
24621,Jim,"Well, I tried.  You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch."
24622,Erin,Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
24623,Erin,Can you just do it?
24624,Erin,That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop.  Oh. I fixed it.
24625,Andy,"Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on.  Oh, there we go."
24626,Pam," He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him."
24627,Jim,"No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'."
24628,Pam,Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
24629,Jim,I tried. He will not listen.
24630,Pam,Did you actually try your hardest?
24631,Jim,"Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up."
24632,Jim,Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
24633,Pam,"If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do."
24634,Darryl, What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
24635,Kevin,"That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model."
24636,Darryl,"Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my  chubby daughter?"
24637,Darryl,"Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun."
24638,Pam,Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
24639,Erin,"Yes, this is too tan. This right here-"
24640,Erin,This is a tanned spot.
24641,Andy,"I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you."
24642,Erin,"Well, Andy, I'm not coming back."
24643,Erin,I have a job here. I work for an old lady. 
24644,Andy,"Yeah, that's awesome. That's great."
24645,Kevin," This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me."
24646,Darryl,"No, no, no, no. It's not worth it."
24647,Kevin,"No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year."
24648,Darryl,"Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?"
24649,Darryl,You're not talking... triple digits?
24650,Kevin,"Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits.  Again. "
24651,Dwight,"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick."
24652,Jim,"OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me.  No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?"
24653,Dwight,"Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?"
24654,Jim,Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
24655,Jim,"Dwight, he's gonna kill the store."
24656,Jim,"And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it."
24657,Dwight,Wait.  He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
24658,Dwight,"Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today."
24659,Jim,"OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-"
24660,Dwight,You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
24661,Dwight,"Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!"
24662,Jim,"Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?"
24663,Dwight,AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
24664,Jim,"What? What, what, what, what, what?"
24665,Dwight," Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-"
24666,Dwight,My wound hasn't healed yet.
24667,Jim,"I'm so sorry, I forgot."
24668,Jim,You all right? You ok?
24669,Andy,I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
24670,Oscar,We knew. Ryan told us.
24671,Andy,"Ryan, why didn't you tell me?"
24672,Ryan,Thought you checker my Tumblr?
24673,Andy,You never update it.
24674,Ryan,"Well, I updated it."
24675,Andy,"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?"
24676,Pam,"We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. "
24677,Jim,What are you doing?
24678,Dwight,I was trying to go-
24679,Jim,Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
24680,Dwight,Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
24681,Jim,OK.  What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
24682,Darryl, Hi. This is Alex.
24683,Darryl, Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
24684,Kevin,Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
24685,Darryl,"I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens."
24686,Kevin,"Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?"
24687,Kevin,What do you mean?
24688,Darryl,I'm out. And so is Toby.
24689,Darryl,This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
24690,Kevin,"No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything.  I'm even gonna kiss Meredith.  That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. "
24691,Jim," What are you doing? No. No, no, no."
24692,Dwight,Anything else you need to talk about?
24693,Jim,Nope. I think that was it. 
24694,Dwight," Once again, it's show time."
24695,Darryl," Hey, hey. They're back. "
24696,Jim,"Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?"
24697,Pam,"Aw, I missed you."
24698,Andy,"I'm going to Florida to get Erin.  Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so-  'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!"
24699,Pam," This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling."
24700,Pam,"There's this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it's not -- it doesn't sound cool. You just have to see it."
24701,Pam,"Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal."
24702,Jim,Wow. It's the end of an era.
24703,Pam,"Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home."
24704,Oscar,I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
24705,Kevin,"When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel."
24706,Ryan,"How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin?"
24707,Kevin,"I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ""Look, a balloon."""
24708,Dwight,My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
24709,Darryl,I was still thinking of going back to school.
24710,Jim,And I was still just a paper salesman.
24711,Dwight,"Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. "
24712,Jim,Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
24713,Jim,What brings you to town?
24714,Dwight,How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
24715,Pam,You messed up saying your name?
24716,Jim,"No, that's Andy's office."
24717,Erin,"Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo."
24718,Erin,How are you? How's your family doing?
24719,Erin,"Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money.  Listen to me, bragging away."
24720,Kevin,"Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?"
24721,Andy,"Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick."
24722,Andy,"Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the..."
24723,Andy,"I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right?  Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP."
24724,Jim,Can't you do something about this?
24725,Jim,What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
24726,Erin,I'm in the bathroom.
24727,Andy," Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!"
24728,Erin,"Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you."
24729,Andy,"Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you."
24730,Erin,"Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn."
24731,Erin,"Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you."
24732,Jim,"I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name."
24733,Pam,"Robert, is Nellie our new manager?"
24734,Pam,How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
24735,Erin,"Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better."
24736,Andy,"Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know."
24737,Erin,"So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend."
24738,Andy,"All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you."
24739,Erin,You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
24740,Pam,No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
24741,Andy," Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-"
24742,Erin,"Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. "
24743,Andy,"Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger."
24744,Andy,I don't know.  Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
24745,Andy,I don't think it does that.
24746,Jim,"Andy, where are you?"
24747,Andy,"I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man."
24748,Jim,"What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job."
24749,Andy,"What do you mean, take my job?"
24750,Jim,"Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager."
24751,Andy,"Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later."
24752,Jim,"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager."
24753,Angela,Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
24754,Pam,I like working here.
24755,Jim,"Dwight, should she be our manager?"
24756,Dwight,I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
24757,Dwight,"Those who can't farm, farm celery."
24758,Jim,And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? 
24759,Dwight,"I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever."
24760,Dwight,There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
24761,Dwight,Five percent. No less.
24762,Dwight,"Six percent, I know my worth."
24763,Jim,The raise isn't real.
24764,Dwight,Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
24765,Jim,Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
24766,Jim,"Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis."
24767,Jim,"Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry."
24768,Jim,"Oh, god, nature, please."
24769,Jim,Was that not the--
24770,Jim,"Was that it? No, that wasn't bad."
24771,Jim,No. I would've said no.
24772,Jim,"I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that."
24773,Dwight,"No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now."
24774,Dwight,"Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off."
24775,Dwight," Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow."
24776,Dwight, Well fought. I accept the outcome.
24777,Erin,I've heard that's amazing when it works.
24778,Andy,"Yeah, if I had my own--"
24779,Erin,"Andy, I care about you and I think--"
24780,Andy,"Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?"
24781,Erin,"Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?"
24782,Andy,You broke my heart too.
24783,Erin,"You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be."
24784,Andy,I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
24785,Pam,"Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy."
24786,Pam,"Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?"
24787,Pam,"Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle."
24788,Pam,I think... you're a witch.
24789,Erin,Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
24790,Erin,"Irene, what would you do without me?"
24791,Jim,"No, it's not, because you don't really work here."
24792,Jim,"Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises."
24793,Jim,Let's see it. Show of hands.
24794,Kevin,I do.  Come on everyone...
24795,Jim,"All right, guys, stop."
24796,Kevin,"Come on Jim, you're killing her!"
24797,Andy,"That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm.  It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it."
24798,Erin,"Andy wait!  Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I'm sorry."
24799,Erin,Let's get out of here.
24800,Andy,"Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff."
24801,Erin,"No, I don't have any stuff."
24802,Andy,Like your toothbrush and stuff.
24803,Erin,I don't have one.
24804,Andy,You don't have a toothbrush?
24805,Andy,How do you not have a toothbrush?
24806,Erin,I just... there's always one around.
24807,Andy,You just use whichever one is sitting there?
24808,Erin,I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
24809,Andy,Of course. I own my toothbrush.
24810,Pam,Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
24811,Jim,"Oh, great.  ""Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy."" Oh that's not good."
24812,Pam,It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
24813,Jim,Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
24814,Oscar,"Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache."
24815,Pam,"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?"
24816,Pam,Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
24817,Jim,"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?"
24818,Angela,'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
24819,Pam,"Okay, which one of these looks more right? "
24820,Dwight,"Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left."
24821,Jim,"Okay, quick. Who says moustache? "
24822,Jim,Who says no moustache? 
24823,Pam,"Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day."
24824,Oscar,"Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive."
24825,Oscar,What does that mean?
24826,Pam,"I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?"
24827,Jim,"I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment."
24828,Pam,I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
24829,Jim,Why is she here?
24830,Andy, Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
24831,Andy,"On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania."
24832,Erin,Oh. That must be nice.
24833,Andy,Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
24834,Erin,"Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents."
24835,Andy, Time to have a little kiss!
24836,Andy,Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
24837,Andy,I believe in that.
24838,Erin,Yes. So do I.
24839,Andy,"I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important."
24840,Oscar,"She's always late, she's always rude..."
24841,Angela, We should do it right here in the break room. 
24842,Andy,"...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you."
24843,Erin,"Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds."
24844,Erin," I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario."
24845,Andy,"Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-"
24846,Andy,I just need you to know-
24847,Erin,What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. 
24848,Jim,"Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door."
24849,Dwight,"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? ""Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."""
24850,Jim,That was one time-
24851,Dwight,I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
24852,Jim," Excuse me, one second. Hi."
24853,Jim,"Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight."
24854,Jim,That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
24855,Pam,"So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad."
24856,Jim,Sounds like every other party.
24857,Pam,"No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card."
24858,Jim,Oh! Hire a magician.
24859,Andy,Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
24860,Andy,"Hey, Lauren. Look at you."
24861,Andy,"I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica."
24862,Andy,"Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car."
24863,Erin,"So, I'm Erin. Hi."
24864,Andy,Yep. This is Erin.
24865,Erin,"Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?"
24866,Andy,"Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-"
24867,Dwight,I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
24868,Jim," ""Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie."""
24869,Dwight,I have to see these shoes.
24870,Jim,I doubt that they're sh-
24871,Jim,Whoa. Who is this guy?
24872,Dwight,Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
24873,Dwight,Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
24874,Dwight,You read my mind.
24875,Jim,Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
24876,Dwight,Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
24877,Jim,Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
24878,Jim,"Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just..."
24879,Dwight,That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
24880,Jim,I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
24881,Dwight,"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick."
24882,Jim,"No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or..."
24883,Jim," You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff."
24884,Pam,"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you."
24885,Jim,"No, that's not what I-"
24886,Jim,"Absolutely. Yeah.  Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me."
24887,Pam,"Oh, okay. Okay, I will. "
24888,Angela,"Pam, we have a great idea."
24889,Angela,We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
24890,Pam,"We discuss...  the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party.  Not mean."
24891,Angela,"I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know."
24892,Oscar,We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
24893,Pam,What are you talking about? Yes we can.
24894,Oscar,What I mean to say is we don't want to.
24895,Andy,It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy pen1s?
24896,Erin,"No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears."
24897,Andy,"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life.  I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one."
24898,Andy,"Oh, he's out there."
24899,Andy,"Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so..."
24900,Andy, By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
24901,Pam,"Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? "
24902,Darryl,"Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag."
24903,Ryan,"Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult."
24904,Oscar,Plus everyone would know who you meant.
24905,Pam,"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?"
24906,Ryan,"Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember."
24907,Pam,'Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
24908,Kevin,"Shh, here she comes!"
24909,Erin,Maybe we should just go.
24910,Andy,"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?"
24911,Andy,"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?"
24912,Andy,"Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends."
24913,Andy,"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now."
24914,Andy,Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
24915,Andy,"I am gay, and I prefer men."
24916,Andy,"You did not, Kenny!"
24917,Andy,I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
24918,Andy,"Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos."
24919,Andy,"Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-"
24920,Andy,Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am.  So... we should probably... go.
24921,Oscar,"To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company."
24922,Oscar,"Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company."
24923,Angela,"Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. "
24924,Jim,"Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with."
24925,Erin,That was a really rough scene.
24926,Andy,Oh... at least we can kiss now.
24927,Andy,"You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time."
24928,Erin,"Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired."
24929,Erin,Probably from seeing that turkey.
24930,Erin,When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
24931,Jim,"Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer."
24932,Jim, It's the four of hearts.
24933,Jim,Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
24934,Pam,"That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears."
24935,Kevin,"You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?"
24936,Erin,What? Why are we-
24937,Andy,I just gotta do one thing. 
24938,Andy,"Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material."
24939,Pam,I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
24940,Jim,"Well, turns out he actually made it up there."
24941,Pam,"Yeah, he came and went."
24942,Pam,Let's just- let's go.
24943,Jim,"Phyllis says the same twelve clichés every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates."
24944,Darryl,So how was the drive in?
24945,Oscar,Time's almost up. How many are left?
24946,Pam,"Just one. ""This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book."""
24947,Darryl,Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
24948,Pam,"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?"
24949,Jim,And that's noon. Exactly. 
24950,Andy, My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
24951,Andy,"Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi."
24952,Kevin, Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
24953,Andy,What happened to old salty?
24954,Dwight,Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
24955,Dwight,"I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter."
24956,Andy,"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about."
24957,Andy,I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
24958,Andy,"Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance."
24959,Andy,"Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better."
24960,Andy,Get back to normalcy.
24961,Pam,"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have."
24962,Pam,"Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl."
24963,Jim,"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it."
24964,Pam,Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
24965,Pam, Kelly has been a handful in the past.
24966,Pam, But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict.  And I just had to get her clean.
24967,Ryan,"Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby."
24968,Jim,"Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby."
24969,Ryan,"Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that."
24970,Pam,Don't shake our baby?
24971,Pam,"Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you."
24972,Pam,"Yeah, I'm glad you said something."
24973,Ryan,"Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not."
24974,Ryan,"Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?"
24975,Pam,"Yeah, they're really great together."
24976,Ryan,"Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?"
24977,Jim,"That's about it, yeah."
24978,Andy,This is what I was trying to tell you.
24979,Andy,You can't dock my pay-
24980,Andy,"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?"
24981,Andy,"Ooh, she's counting again."
24982,Andy,I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
24983,Erin,"When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this."
24984,Andy,You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
24985,Erin,"There you go.  Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date."
24986,Erin,Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
24987,Andy,"Oh, yeah, I was just tired."
24988,Erin,"We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self."
24989,Andy,"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night."
24990,Erin,Really. It's not a big deal.
24991,Andy,Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
24992,Ryan,I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
24993,Ryan,"Yeah, the fractional ownership property.  Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight."
24994,Ryan,"You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link."
24995,Ryan,"I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change."
24996,Erin,When you lost the manager job-
24997,Erin,Did it affect you outside of the office?
24998,Erin,I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
24999,Dwight,"Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never."
25000,Pam,I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
25001,Pam,"Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?"
25002,Pam,"I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming."
25003,Dwight,One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
25004,Dwight,Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
25005,Dwight,"Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that."
25006,Dwight,"Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant."
25007,Andy,You can't call a meeting.  But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
25008,Andy,Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
25009,Andy,Wanted to talk to all of you guys about  importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
25010,Dwight,"It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male."
25011,Oscar,"Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?"
25012,Kevin,Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
25013,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. "
25014,Angela,What are you doing?
25015,Angela,"Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it."
25016,Andy,"Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?"
25017,Andy,I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
25018,Andy,Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
25019,Darryl,"Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what."
25020,Pam,"Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it."
25021,Pam,That a couple of times-
25022,Andy,"Yeah Jim, get it out there."
25023,Jim,"Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had s*x so many times already, I was exhausted..."
25024,Jim,I was very drunk.
25025,Dwight,"You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it."
25026,Jim,"Wow, what are we talking about?"
25027,Erin,"Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?"
25028,Andy," Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet."
25029,Erin,"Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here!  Take 'em yourself!"
25030,Andy,"Oh, and another thing! Our s*x life is none of your businesses!"
25031,Erin,"And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!"
25032,Andy,"Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once!  Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!"
25033,Andy,You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
25034,Andy,"Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? "
25035,Erin,And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
25036,Andy,And your stupid face!  And your stupid office!  Ah!
25037,Darryl,He does not like that wall.
25038,Erin,Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
25039,Andy,That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
25040,Ryan,"Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly."
25041,Pam,All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
25042,Ryan,"Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face."
25043,Pam,"Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much."
25044,Ryan,Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
25045,Oscar,"Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better."
25046,Kevin,"Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package."
25047,Ryan,"Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it."
25048,Pam,"Oh, no, no, no."
25049,Pam,"Read it, please. I love amazing poetry."
25050,Ryan,No. It would cause me too much pain.
25051,Pam,Read through the pain. Be strong.
25052,Ryan,This poem would crush you!
25053,Oscar,"Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!"
25054,Kevin,"Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone."
25055,Ryan,"You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world."
25056,Pam," Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!"
25057,Ryan,You are toxic! You are toxic!
25058,Ryan,"Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt."
25059,Ryan,"Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably."
25060,Pam,"Barf! Ugh, you suck!"
25061,Ryan,"What is your problem?  Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me."
25062,Ryan,Can we turn this -ing thing around? Thank you.
25063,Ryan,"Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly."
25064,Ryan,Will you roll those dice with me?
25065,Jim,"Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing."
25066,Andy,"I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive."
25067,Andy,"Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it."
25068,Erin,But you hurt your hand.
25069,Pam,You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
25070,Jim,"Not at all, can we go?"
25071,Pam,"""Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches."""
25072,Pam,"""He is a drifter out to sea."""
25073,Jim,"""And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green."""
25074,Pam,"It's just so dumb.  But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft..."
25075,Jim,"Uh, Ryan can never know."
25076,Ryan," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no."
25077,Pam,"Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?"
25078,Ryan,"Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know."
25079,Jim,"Wow That's terrible, I really liked him."
25080,Ryan,Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
25081,Jim,"Well, I second that emotion."
25082,Ryan,"Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, ""Tracks of my Tears""?"
25083,Ryan,"Um... God, so many, Nellie!"
25084,Pam,"No, no, no, ""Tracks of My Tears"" and what else? What are some more? What's one more?"
25085,Ryan,"Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today."
25086,Pam,I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
25087,Ryan,"Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles."
25088,Dwight,You don't like the Beatles?
25089,Ryan,That's... That's not the point!
25090,Dwight,Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
25091,Ryan,"Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?"
25092,Oscar,It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
25093,Ryan,"Okay well, that's a relief!"
25094,Jim,Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
25095,Pam,"Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!"
25096,Jim,Tickets are 250 bucks.
25097,Pam,250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
25098,Ryan,Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
25099,Jim,"Okay, you could just show up late though."
25100,Ryan,"How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want."
25101,Pam,Tears of a clown!
25102,Ryan,"Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!"
25103,Angela,Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
25104,Angela,My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
25105,Dwight,"I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed"
25106,Jim,"Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people..."
25107,Dwight,There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
25108,Erin,Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
25109,Dwight,"That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male ""hanging out"". Call the cops!"
25110,Pam,"Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody."
25111,Dwight,"I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof.  And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case."
25112,Erin,"Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see."
25113,Angela,We think you might kill Robert.
25114,Kevin,because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
25115,Andy,"guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser."
25116,Pam,"Oh, great! That sounds good!"
25117,Kevin,"Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird."
25118,Andy,Why would that be weird?
25119,Kevin,"It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week."
25120,Erin,Andy's just coming as my date.
25121,Kevin,"Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird."
25122,Darryl,"You really re-did Andy's office, huh?"
25123,Darryl,"I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out."
25124,Darryl,You could go downstairs and ask them?
25125,Angela,"Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello."
25126,Andy,"Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?"
25127,Kevin,"Oh man, this is weird!"
25128,Andy,"Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body!  I had you, I had you!"
25129,Andy," Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!"
25130,Kevin,"Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!"
25131,Kevin,No! It was my idea to not be raped!
25132,Dwight," Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22  If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!"
25133,Kevin,"Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand."
25134,Dwight,"You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!"
25135,Kevin,"So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!"
25136,Andy,"What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it."
25137,Jim,"Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us."
25138,Andy,The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
25139,Pam,Sounds like you're doing alright.
25140,Andy,"Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!"
25141,Ryan,"Oh, this guy is having a breakdown."
25142,Oscar,my dog Gerald is my life.
25143,Oscar,"This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela."
25144,Andy,"Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?"
25145,Andy,"You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control."
25146,Andy,Evil!  although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
25147,Andy,"Me, I guess.  We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!"
25148,Andy,You're being a Thomas Oregon!
25149,Andy,"Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?"
25150,Andy," Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please."
25151,Andy,then I'll take a table!
25152,Andy,"And a high five!  Oh, let's do this again!"
25153,Andy," Oh, yes indeed... When!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads!  When!"
25154,Oscar,I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
25155,Jim,"Wait, what? Come on!"
25156,Oscar,"We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it."
25157,Jim,"Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?"
25158,Oscar,"Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote."
25159,Jim,"Okay, what was this look? "
25160,Jim,"What happened, did he do it?"
25161,Pam,Are you-- Twice! For real?
25162,Jim,"Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey."
25163,Pam,Life is Downton Abbey.
25164,Jim,Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
25165,Dwight, How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
25166,Dwight,It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
25167,Andy,"Hey, how are you?"
25168,Andy,"No, got canned last week."
25169,Andy,"No, best thing that ever happened to me."
25170,Darryl,I can go get us some tacos.
25171,Darryl,If you loan me some money.
25172,Jim,what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
25173,Pam,Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
25174,Oscar,He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
25175,Pam,"Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!"
25176,Jim,"Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!"
25177,Andy,can you believe this guy?
25178,Andy,Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
25179,Andy,I will! I will take all of those dogs!
25180,Andy,"No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated."
25181,Andy,"No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference.  This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference  thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!"
25182,Andy,Okay! Hope you all learned something!
25183,Andy,I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
25184,Pam,"Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar."
25185,Oscar,sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
25186,Oscar,"No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster."
25187,Darryl,"Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!"
25188,Dwight," Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!"
25189,Dwight,"Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!"
25190,Jim,Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
25191,Dwight,"Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! "
25192,Oscar,"Nice to see you again, it was lovely!"
25193,Oscar,why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
25194,Andy, so it just goes on under here like this?
25195,Jim,"Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing."
25196,Andy,I am so great!
25197,Erin,"He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse."
25198,Jim,"Look at that one though, he's smiling!"
25199,Andy,This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
25200,Kevin,"I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best."
25201,Andy,"You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--"
25202,Jim,"Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh."
25203,Pam,"Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!"
25204,Andy,"Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!"
25205,Jim,Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
25206,Andy,"Yeah, I do. I have that."
25207,Erin,You're going to be alright
25208,Kevin,No. No he's not.
25209,Andy,"Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!"
25210,Kevin,Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
25211,Erin,So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
25212,Darryl,"Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs."
25213,Kevin,"My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill."
25214,Pam,What do you feed her?
25215,Kevin,"Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!"
25216,Darryl,Is she sick? How are her poops?
25217,Kevin,"Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it."
25218,Kevin,"She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown."
25219,Kevin,"People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right!  Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!"
25220,Dwight,"Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen?   There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you?  Mwah."
25221,Dwight,"Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?"
25222,Jim,"Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that � flat curl contest."
25223,Jim,"All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go."
25224,Dwight,"Feast on this, Lewis."
25225,Jim,"Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed."
25226,Jim,"Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows."
25227,Jim,"Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,"
25228,Jim,"All right, easy there, grandpa."
25229,Dwight,I don't need your help.
25230,Jim,Okay. You don't need my help?
25231,Andy,Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot... these.
25232,Andy,You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
25233,Erin,"Andy, if you're gonna hang out for a while, uh..."
25234,Erin,"This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in."
25235,Andy,Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me?
25236,Erin,"No, of course not. It's just � I think it's like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it's like, where does it end? So just... "
25237,Andy,"Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? ...Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like."
25238,Jim,"All right, well, enjoy the alumni game."
25239,Dwight,"Good, we have a deal?"
25240,Dwight,Thanks so much Earl.
25241,Dwight,And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!
25242,Andy,Lot going on guys. What's happening?
25243,Jim,Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
25244,Andy,"That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo."
25245,Jim,"Hey, hey, come on, language."
25246,Dwight,"Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes."
25247,Dwight,"No, Jim, the butt, in his butt."
25248,Jim,"Sorry, man, I can't focus on zingers. There's too many potential clients."
25249,Oscar,Why did Binghamton close?
25250,Kevin,The branch closed. Forever.
25251,Pam,"Oh, it was this summer �"
25252,Pam,"Um, I am a little busy."
25253,Pam,"Yeah, I can make you a list."
25254,Pam,Why don't I help you now?
25255,Erin,"Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?"
25256,Andy,"Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato."
25257,Jim,"The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it."
25258,Dwight,Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to � how do I put this � steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
25259,Jim,"Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money."
25260,Jim,Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. 
25261,Dwight, There he is. That's Lloyd.
25262,Jim,There's actually not a rule that says that.
25263,Dwight,"Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now."
25264,Jim,How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
25265,Dwight,"Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg."
25266,Andy,Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
25267,Andy,"I forgot, a... a pan, uh �"
25268,Dwight,"Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say."
25269,Dwight,Don't listen to him.
25270,Dwight,"Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert."
25271,Andy,"Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client.  I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all."
25272,Dwight,"Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first."
25273,Dwight,Wha � what is this supposed to be?
25274,Dwight,"Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose."
25275,Jim,"Hold on, hold on. Is this him?"
25276,Dwight,It's him! Do something! Get out!
25277,Jim,What? What am I gonna do? I don't �
25278,Dwight,"Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood.  That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay."
25279,Dwight,"Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos."
25280,Jim,Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
25281,Jim,"Oh, yeah, definitely have nos."
25282,Jim,Brace yourself. 3... 2...
25283,Jim,1. Here we go! 
25284,Andy,Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
25285,Andy,"No, I do not."
25286,Andy,"Seriously? �Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you."
25287,Pam,"So...what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?"
25288,Angela," Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg."
25289,Angela,Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? 
25290,Angela,I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
25291,Andy,I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
25292,Andy,No. I'm a rogue.
25293,Andy,Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now...  I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
25294,Andy,"Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house.  Whatever you need � anytime, night or day � you just stop on by."
25295,Andy,Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
25296,Dwight,"Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. "
25297,Jim," Dwight, what are you doing?"
25298,Dwight,"Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!"
25299,Jim,What are you talking about?
25300,Dwight,Just run! Take the stairs!
25301,Jim,I don't even know where the stairs are!
25302,Dwight,I'll stall him. Go!
25303,Dwight,I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours.  Oh.  My pants fell down.
25304,Dwight,My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
25305,Dwight," Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton."
25306,Dwight,I was here first.
25307,Dwight,I already made an appointment... with your secretary.
25308,Dwight,"Wait, it's not D.M Utica, is it?"
25309,Jim,Big Red Paper Company?
25310,Dwight,Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
25311,Jim,"All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these."
25312,Dwight,No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
25313,Dwight,Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
25314,Jim,But you're saying there's a chance.
25315,Pam,I stole Nellie's phone.
25316,Pam,What do you want from me?
25317,Pam,"Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted."
25318,Pam,Um... yes. Definitely. With your hair �
25319,Pam,Certainly. Um... you dropped your cell phone.
25320,Pam,No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
25321,Pam,"No, I will not."
25322,Pam,But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals.
25323,Pam,No... don't. Just put it out of your mind.
25324,Erin,There's a call for you on line one.
25325,Erin,He says salvation. No last name.
25326,Andy," You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer."
25327,Andy,Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. 
25328,Andy,You got a minute?
25329,Andy,I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
25330,Andy,Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
25331,Jim,"Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions."
25332,Jim,"Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine."
25333,Dwight,How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
25334,Jim,"I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?"
25335,Oscar," Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-"
25336,Dwight,He's searching out younger gays.
25337,Oscar,"No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead."
25338,Oscar,"No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-"
25339,Oscar,Do you not own a mirror?
25340,Pam,"I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things."
25341,Oscar,"Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-"
25342,Kevin,"Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you.  Ooh! "
25343,Dwight,Put some ice on it.
25344,Oscar,"In any case, it gets better.  Maybe- maybe not much better... but better."
25345,Dwight,"I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, ""muffin basket."" Then I thought, ""What's even more precious to people than muffins?"""
25346,Dwight,"Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?"
25347,Dwight,"Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them."
25348,Jim,"I know why you're doing this, Dwight."
25349,Jim,"Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest."
25350,Dwight," Wha-?  Damn it, Jim!"
25351,Jim,Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
25352,Darryl,Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
25353,Darryl,You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
25354,Darryl,And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
25355,Darryl,"Aw, come on. What's the harm?  Mmm. What flavor was that?"
25356,Darryl,The coconut's pretty subtle.
25357,Darryl,"I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was-  ooh, hold on a second.  Oh."
25358,Darryl,"If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself."
25359,Jim,"How's it going, man?"
25360,Andy," I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?"
25361,Andy,"Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants..."
25362,Andy,Pull the poop out of the toilets.
25363,Andy,I have a delicious secret.
25364,Jim,Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
25365,Andy,"Yeah, it is actually."
25366,Andy,"Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager."
25367,Pam,"What? Honey, we talked about this."
25368,Jim,"No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap."
25369,Pam,"Yes, and then we decided that was crazy."
25370,Jim,"No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it."
25371,Pam,"No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?"
25372,Pam,We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
25373,Jim,But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
25374,Pam,But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
25375,Pam,And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
25376,Dwight,"Great, right up there."
25377,Jim,Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
25378,Jim,Alright. Why don't you just-
25379,Pam,"Oh, great. Thank you."
25380,Pam,I'll just stand here?
25381,Jim,"Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great."
25382,Jim,"Let's do it, shoot it."
25383,Jim,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
25384,Dwight,"Jim, right here, right here.  Okay, good."
25385,Jim,"Oh, so that's it?"
25386,Pam,See? That wasn't so hard.
25387,Dwight,"Cute kids, thanks for coming."
25388,Angela,"Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?"
25389,Erin,"Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. "
25390,Dwight,"Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela."
25391,Dwight,Nice to see you. May I hold him?
25392,Angela,No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
25393,Angela,"I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with."
25394,Dwight,"Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place."
25395,Angela, No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
25396,Andy,This is getting more and more delicious by the minute.  It's go time.
25397,Andy,"Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup."
25398,Andy,But it's really good-  Oh!
25399,Erin,I know this is going to be a great payoff.
25400,Erin,"But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake."
25401,Erin,Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
25402,Dwight,"Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-"
25403,Angela,"Uh-uh, leave us alone."
25404,Dwight,"Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?"
25405,Darryl,"A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?"
25406,Darryl,"Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page."
25407,Darryl,Good luck to you.
25408,Angela,"I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight."
25409,Angela,No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
25410,Dwight,Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
25411,Andy,I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
25412,Jim,"No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk..."
25413,Erin,"No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me."
25414,Andy,No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
25415,Erin,"He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-"
25416,Andy,"That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest."
25417,Andy,"I just gonna- quick-  Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay.  Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!"
25418,Andy,I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
25419,Oscar,David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
25420,Andy,"Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum ""Suck It"" to the U.S. military."
25421,Kevin,Even I know that's weird.
25422,Andy,"I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy."
25423,Andy,Stop saying my name.
25424,Erin,"No, he's not making this up."
25425,Erin,Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
25426,Pam,But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
25427,Andy,"Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace."
25428,Dwight, Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
25429,Pam,"David, what are you doing here?"
25430,Andy,What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
25431,Andy,But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
25432,Andy,Wow. From janitor to manager?
25433,Andy,That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
25434,Andy,"From total loss to total boss, I mean-"
25435,Andy,I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
25436,Andy,Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
25437,Jim,Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
25438,Andy,"Gosh, I hope so."
25439,Angela,"No! God, Mose! God!"
25440,Angela,Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
25441,Angela,"Yes!  Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!"
25442,Darryl, Let's see that smile. Go on. 
25443,Andy,Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
25444,Andy,It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
25445,Andy,Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
25446,Andy,I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
25447,Andy,If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
25448,Andy,"All right, you sly b*st*rd. When can you start?"
25449,Andy,Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
25450,Dwight,They're testing it now.
25451,Angela,How long does it take to get the results?
25452,Angela,You're gonna wait here?
25453,Angela," Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!"
25454,Oscar,"Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?"
25455,Oscar,"Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me..."
25456,Erin,"Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time."
25457,Dwight,"How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news."
25458,Kevin,"Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles."
25459,Oscar, That piece doesn't go there. 
25460,Kevin,"So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time."
25461,Pam,"For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great."
25462,Jim,You are really good at modesty. She's a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children�
25463,Pam,"Kay, well, you had that interesting thing."
25464,Pam,"Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college."
25465,Jim,Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
25466,Pam,And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
25467,Jim,"In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea."
25468,Pam,He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.
25469,Jim,An Altima or better.
25470,Erin,I'm so happy for you Kelly.
25471,Ryan,"I've actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town. And, uh, that's not garbage, it's out clothes."
25472,Pam,And that was our summer.
25473,Pam,"Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company."
25474,Pam,"Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time."
25475,Erin,Andy's coming back today!
25476,Jim,"No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim."
25477,Erin,"Andy's here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy's here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here. Pam, he's here. "
25478,Andy,"Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!"
25479,Andy,What're you still doing here?
25480,Andy,You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
25481,Andy,"See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um�"
25482,Andy,In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
25483,Andy,Cause you're always taking dumps.
25484,Andy,"Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time."
25485,Darryl,"Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr."
25486,Andy,"No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane."
25487,Dwight,I don't see it.
25488,Andy,"Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?"
25489,Dwight,"Yes, yes I am. "
25490,Dwight,In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.
25491,Angela,"Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption."
25492,Kevin,"The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?"
25493,Kevin,"Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin."
25494,Angela,"No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants"
25495,Angela,"Please, after the turtle?"
25496,Kevin,I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
25497,Angela,"Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?"
25498,Oscar,"No, I'm a dog person."
25499,Angela,"If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person."
25500,Oscar,"Those guys always change back, Angela."
25501,Andy,"David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm."
25502,Andy,"Yeah, I gotta go David.  Why is Nellie still here?"
25503,Andy,"Mm, then I will make up a cause."
25504,Andy,Then forget I just told you that.
25505,Andy,Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
25506,Dwight,"Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!"
25507,Dwight,"Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?"
25508,Dwight,"Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?"
25509,Dwight,"Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head."
25510,Dwight,"So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?"
25511,Dwight,Spoken like a true root man.
25512,Dwight,You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
25513,Dwight,With my leads and stuff like that?
25514,Dwight,Cause you're interested in going into sales?
25515,Dwight,"Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?"
25516,Dwight,You're not getting my clients! Nice try.
25517,Dwight,"Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job."
25518,Dwight,"Jim, get ready for the battle of your life."
25519,Dwight,The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
25520,Jim,"Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday."
25521,Dwight,"Wait, sales�what sales meeting?"
25522,Jim,The new guys called one.
25523,Dwight,The new guys called a sales meeting?
25524,Jim,Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
25525,Dwight,There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
25526,Jim,You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect.  Too easy.
25527,Angela,Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no.
25528,Angela,"Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I'm fine with either, but not both.  Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, ok?"
25529,Andy,I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.
25530,Andy,"No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you."
25531,Andy,Now this is called slack lining.
25532,Andy,"I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb."
25533,Andy,"If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather."
25534,Andy,"That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack."
25535,Jim,You a sports fan?
25536,Jim,Oh. Any team sports?
25537,Jim,"Phillies fan, though, right?"
25538,Jim,"No, like baseball. A baseball team."
25539,Jim,I have nothing in common with Plop.
25540,Andy,"All right, who's next? Nellie?"
25541,Andy,Nonsense. Get up here.
25542,Andy,"Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?"
25543,Andy,"Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa!  You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?"
25544,Darryl,This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
25545,Andy,Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
25546,Andy,"Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up."
25547,Andy,Focus on the horizon.  Whoa! Look at this guy.
25548,Dwight,"Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!"
25549,Andy,Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
25550,Andy,Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
25551,Dwight,"Ok, I am just getting started, ok?"
25552,Andy,Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
25553,Dwight, That's not true. Just give me another chance.
25554,Oscar,But your mouth is ble�
25555,Dwight,This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it.  Idiots.
25556,Dwight,"Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!"
25557,Dwight,"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on."
25558,Pam, What are you doing?
25559,Dwight,"Come here, I'll show you."
25560,Angela,Why do you want this cat?
25561,Angela,How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
25562,Angela,Have you taken any concrete steps?
25563,Jim,"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing.  Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim."
25564,Dwight,Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
25565,Dwight,"You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?"
25566,Pam,"Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds."
25567,Dwight,So you'll do it?
25568,Dwight,"Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life."
25569,Pam,"Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life."
25570,Pam,Exactly the way it is.
25571,Pam,"Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it."
25572,Pam,"Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis."
25573,Dwight,"I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive."
25574,Angela,"No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night."
25575,Oscar,You know what? I will take Comstock.
25576,Angela,"Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!"
25577,Oscar,I'll come by after work and pick him up.
25578,Angela,"Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight"
25579,Angela,Please don't teach the cat French.
25580,Oscar," Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock."
25581,Jim,Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
25582,Dwight,"Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!"
25583,Jim,"Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye.  Yeah!"
25584,Andy,There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
25585,Pam," The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel."
25586,Kevin," Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?"
25587,Pam,"Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and... you see what chore you get that day."
25588,Kevin,A wheel is supposed to spin.
25589,Erin,"Yeah, you know, like  guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh... guh."
25590,Pam,"No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-"
25591,Andy," Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores."
25592,Jim, Spinning would be more fun.
25593,Kevin," Okay, that's what I'm talking about! Big money, big money!  Mug duty?"
25594,Pam,"Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink."
25595,Erin,"Yeah, seriously, it's like everything on there is work."
25596,Pam,I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's-
25597,Kevin,"Yeah, I don't think that you understand wheels."
25598,Pam,"I've been through several rounds of development with the team and here's where we stand with the chore wheel.  We've got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it's more fun this way."
25599,Pam, The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute no one seems to mind.
25600,Jim," Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma's got breakfast, OK?  We are going to Roy's wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife's ex-fiancé's wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it's your wife's ex-fiancé."
25601,Pam,Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs.
25602,Jim,"Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding."
25603,Pam,Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
25604,Erin," Oh, Pete, you've got mail."
25605,Erin,"Well, it's addressed to Customer Service so, it's your mail."
25606,Erin,"Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time."
25607,Erin,"Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It's not a nice letter."
25608,Jim, Is this his house?
25609,Jim,"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn't know. Um... actually I did tell Pam and we decided �no'. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be."
25610,Kevin, Oh boy! What's happening?
25611,Angela,"Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.  I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?"
25612,Kevin," Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank."
25613,Dwight,I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
25614,Andy,"Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives."
25615,Andy,I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
25616,Dwight,"Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation."
25617,Dwight,Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
25618,Dwight,Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
25619,Dwight,"Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. "
25620,Jim," There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?"
25621,Jim,"Thanks for inviting us, by the way-"
25622,Jim,"That was, that was a surprise."
25623,Jim,"By the way, man, this place is... beautiful."
25624,Jim,"Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-"
25625,Jim,"Yeah, you never know."
25626,Erin,"Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad."
25627,Erin,"You mean, put me on the news?"
25628,Erin,"Maybe, ok? Let me think about it."
25629,Erin,"I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?"
25630,Darryl," You got this, Roy. "
25631,Pam, We still surprise each other.
25632,Pam,"You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-"
25633,Pam,"Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-"
25634,Jim,It was an away game.
25635,Pam,"In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams.  Do we know everything about each other?"
25636,Pam,Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
25637,Jim," Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-"
25638,Pam,And you thought you guys were millionaires.
25639,Jim,You heard that one.
25640,Pam,"Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember."
25641,Jim,That I thought we were millionaires.
25642,Pam,"Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one."
25643,Angela,The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. 
25644,Dwight,Anything else would be inconsistent.
25645,Dwight,I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh.  You don't have a plan.
25646,Dwight,"Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you."
25647,Dwight," This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most."
25648,Dwight,Sounds like a plan.
25649,Andy, Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
25650,Andy," Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?"
25651,Andy,"Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff."
25652,Oscar, Next question for our oldie-weds-
25653,Kevin,What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
25654,Oscar,Pam's first celebrity crush.
25655,Pam,Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
25656,Angela,"OK, I have one. I have one. "
25657,Kevin, What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
25658,Angela," Kevin, stop it with that question."
25659,Jim," Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!"
25660,Jim,It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
25661,Pam,I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
25662,Darryl,"Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence."
25663,Andy,Her body. We're gonna talk about her body.  Good. Great job.
25664,Darryl,Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
25665,Andy, Erin has an audition to be a newscaster. 
25666,Andy,"Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl."
25667,Darryl,"OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color."
25668,Jim,I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
25669,Oscar,Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
25670,Andy,News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
25671,Oscar,"I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite."
25672,Oscar,"Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or..."
25673,Angela,Has she done the pageant circuit?
25674,Erin,"No, I watch the news."
25675,Andy,She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
25676,Erin,"This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job."
25677,Dwight, This is it. Any questions?
25678,Dwight,No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
25679,Erin," Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented."
25680,Darryl,"Um, where did you get that story?"
25681,Erin,"A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events."
25682,Andy,"I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name."
25683,Erin,"For Channel 11 news, I'm Erin Hannon."
25684,Erin,For Channel 11 news... I'm Erin Hannon.
25685,Darryl,That was a good one.
25686,Andy,"Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy."
25687,Erin,Got it. For Channel 11 news... 
25688,Andy,OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
25689,Jim, I can feel you looking at me.
25690,Pam,"OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-"
25691,Pam,"I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know."
25692,Jim, That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
25693,Pam,"Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me."
25694,Jim,"God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well."
25695,Dwight,Ha!  This is for real this time.
25696,Darryl,It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little  inspiration.
25697,Darryl,127 hours. It's about this guy who-
25698,Dwight,"No, no. No spoilers. Please."
25699,Erin, The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
25700,Andy," Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen."
25701,Erin,"Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked."
25702,Andy,"Just, you sure Clark?"
25703,Andy,"No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that."
25704,Erin,Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
25705,Andy,"I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing."
25706,Andy,"Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?"
25707,Andy,OK.  I'll call you later.
25708,Andy, So this is a single.
25709,Erin,"Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy."
25710,Dwight,"If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes."
25711,Dwight,Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
25712,Dwight,"Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid."
25713,Dwight,You're the stupid one.
25714,Dwight,You're the stupid one.
25715,Dwight,"You, you, you, you..."
25716,Dwight,You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
25717,Dwight,"Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?"
25718,Dwight,"How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!"
25719,Dwight,You don't work here! You're not Jim!
25720,Pam,"Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico's at 7:30."
25721,Pam,Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
25722,Dwight,"I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!"
25723,Dwight,"Oh my�! Oh d�! Oh, how did�?  Huhhhhh!"
25724,Erin,Getting things done. Awesome!
25725,Darryl,"It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!"
25726,Darryl,"Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let's knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here.  Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament."
25727,Erin," S""il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh!"
25728,Dwight,"Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat."
25729,Erin,I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
25730,Dwight,You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
25731,Dwight,"Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads."
25732,Dwight,I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
25733,Erin,Yeah! Let's do it!
25734,Dwight,"It means ""excellent"". And we have begun."
25735,Pam,. Is everything okay?
25736,Andy, Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
25737,Pam,"Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime."
25738,Pam," I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch."
25739,Jim,Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
25740,Andy,Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
25741,Andy,This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
25742,Andy,"My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama."
25743,Erin,"I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, ""What's your stance on politics?"" Or, ""What is the best war to do?"" And, I will just be like, ""Duhhhh!"""
25744,Andy,"Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama."
25745,Darryl,"You log in sales at ten different times. If you log �em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching."
25746,Jim,"That was really good, Darryl."
25747,Jim,"Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me�."
25748,Andy," Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?"
25749,Darryl,"Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross."
25750,Andy,It's me!  I am related to Michelle Obama.
25751,Andy,"I mean, it's distant, but..."
25752,Darryl," Huh ha! That's cool, man."
25753,Andy,"Darryl said, ""Cool, man."" He called me as cool man."
25754,Pam,"You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat."
25755,Pam,Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
25756,Oscar,"I'm just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?"
25757,Dwight,"More of a, barbaric growl."
25758,Dwight,Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse!
25759,Pam,"Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?"
25760,Pam,So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
25761,Pam,Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
25762,Oscar,"Well, if there's another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I�"
25763,Andy,"What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it.  I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! ."
25764,Oscar,Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
25765,Andy,Why? Is it employee's day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
25766,Oscar,"Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were�slave owners."
25767,Andy,Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
25768,Darryl,Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
25769,Andy,"Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye."
25770,Andy,"Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!"
25771,Darryl,I included some time saving ideas...
25772,Andy,"Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now."
25773,Darryl,"Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird."
25774,Andy," Right on, brotha. Wurddd."
25775,Dwight,Daraas!  Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
25776,Pam,"Yeah�turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again�those are the wipers. So�the�its�just. There you go! Yeah.  Yeah, things get so busy with the kids�red light�that it's nice to have that creative outlet�red light! Red light! Red! Red!"
25777,Pam,"Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby."
25778,Pam,Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
25779,Andy,". Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?"
25780,Andy,"So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today."
25781,Erin,Because of your slaves.
25782,Andy,"Not my slaves, my ancestors'. Maybe. Probably not."
25783,Erin,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ""slave master"", ""attafrauk!"", is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?"
25784,Andy,That you're learning a made-up language from HBO's Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
25785,Erin,"Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language."
25786,Dwight,"People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it."
25787,Andy,Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
25788,Andy,"Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be�. Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"" by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith�African American�Mambazo."
25789,Pam,"Good. Very good. Oh�no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. ""New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P."" And then in parentheses, he wrote out ""as soon as possible."""
25790,Pam,"Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding."
25791,Pam,Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
25792,Pam,"I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there's something Jim isn't telling me."
25793,Pam,Because he just loves me too much.
25794,Andy,"I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States."
25795,Andy,Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
25796,Andy,No. Not that I see here.
25797,Kevin,Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
25798,Andy,"You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!"
25799,Jim,"Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True� Oh no."
25800,Andy,Dwight's grandfather was a�.
25801,Dwight,Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So...
25802,Andy,I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
25803,Dwight,"Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!"
25804,Andy,And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
25805,Angela,Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
25806,Kevin,"Yeah, that�you're being really mean, Andy."
25807,Andy,"No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it."
25808,Oscar,"The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did."
25809,Andy,Might've done. And how... do you figure?
25810,Oscar,Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
25811,Andy,"You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income."
25812,Andy,"We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen."
25813,Andy,"Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had."
25814,Darryl,You're gonna po' mouth
25815,Andy,"Exactly. Help me po' mouth, Darryl."
25816,Darryl,"Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions�"
25817,Andy,"What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?"
25818,Andy,"You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here."
25819,Darryl,I'm going for a walk.
25820,Jim,"You doing alright, man?"
25821,Darryl,I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
25822,Jim,Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
25823,Darryl,"It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets."
25824,Jim,"Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?"
25825,Jim,"No, I'm serious. There's always something better."
25826,Jim,Like hypothetically... if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
25827,Darryl,What kind of job?
25828,Jim,"Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?"
25829,Jim,"Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to..."
25830,Darryl,It's not even a thought�
25831,Jim,Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
25832,Darryl,"What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?"
25833,Jim,"Oh, it's happening! Let's just keep it between you and me for right now."
25834,Darryl,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it?"
25835,Jim,"We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's�I think she understands... what this is."
25836,Darryl,"Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real."
25837,Jim,"What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!"
25838,Darryl,It's not real... until your wife is on board.
25839,Pam,So what did you want to show me?
25840,Pam,Yeah. It's really ugly
25841,Pam,"Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I�Nellie, this is brilliant!  Hey!"
25842,Jim,Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
25843,Pam,What?! No! I-I got this.  Okay?
25844,Darryl,"Yeah. You too, huh?"
25845,Darryl,Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.  Yeah.
25846,Jim,I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
25847,Pam,I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
25848,Pam,I was helping Nellie drive�
25849,Andy,I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
25850,Andy,"Alright everybody, great season of softball, I'm super proud of you guys and I think you're gonna like this little highlight reel that I put together. "
25851,Andy,Andy Bernard presents: Summer Softball Epic Fails!  Fail.  Fail.
25852,Oscar,Is this like a blooper reel?
25853,Darryl,That was a triple.
25854,Andy,Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video!
25855,Oscar,What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
25856,Andy,"Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?"
25857,Jim,"Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?"
25858,Andy,Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..
25859,Andy,That was not a fail.
25860,Andy,That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm.  You're all failing right now.  Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! 
25861,Dwight,Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please.
25862,Dwight,"OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please."
25863,Oscar,It stands for electromagnetic field. Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area  Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
25864,Andy,"Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?"
25865,Andy,"I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?"
25866,Dwight,"OK, listen. Everything here is up to code."
25867,Dwight," Oh, the wires need insulation.  It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat."
25868,Jim,"Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first."
25869,Andy,Fine. I will give you one minute.
25870,Andy,"You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase."
25871,Andy,A baby what? A human?!
25872,Andy,"Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so."
25873,Andy,And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
25874,Andy,And those sand grains are tumbling..
25875,Andy,"Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that."
25876,Dwight," ""Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!"" That means you can't make me do squat."
25877,Dwight,You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
25878,Pam,Week off. That'd be great.
25879,Darryl," Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so."
25880,Darryl,Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
25881,Darryl, What are you doing?
25882,Jim,Getting my wife a week off from work.
25883,Darryl,You popped one kernel.
25884,Jim,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. "
25885,Dwight,"I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way."
25886,Jim," ""Side effects of EMF include: headaches..."""
25887,Dwight,Had 'em all my life.
25888,Dwight,"No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim."
25889,Jim,Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
25890,Dwight,"Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot.  What the?"
25891,Dwight,Some of these kernels have crowned.
25892,Jim,"That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god."
25893,Jim,"I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids."
25894,Pam,"Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?"
25895,Jim,You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
25896,Pam,A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
25897,Jim,"Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied."
25898,Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement."
25899,Dwight,"So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week."
25900,Dwight,"In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour."
25901,Dwight,"Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus.  If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.  In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done."
25902,Oscar," No six after the eight, no...."
25903,Erin," Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard."
25904,Erin," I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe?  Oh well."
25905,Erin,Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
25906,Erin," Just don't tell Andy, because.."
25907,Jim,"Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face."
25908,Jim, I'm so sorry for all of this.
25909,Pam,"It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest."
25910,Angela,"I, I need to get to the paper please. "
25911,Pam,Oh my god! Ah!
25912,Jim,I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
25913,Pam,"You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. "
25914,Jim,"Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking?"
25915,Dwight,"What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage."
25916,Jim,"Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?"
25917,Dwight,It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
25918,Jim,You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
25919,Dwight,No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
25920,Jim,What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?
25921,Andy,"Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving."
25922,Jim,Next stop: Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
25923,Jim," So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?"
25924,Dwight,Get your foot behind the yellow line.
25925,Pam,My name is Pam.
25926,Pam,I like to paint.
25927,Pam,You think you're better?
25928,Pam,Oh no you ain't!
25929,Kevin,My name is Kevin.
25930,Kevin,That is my name.
25931,Kevin,They call me Kevin.
25932,Kevin,Cause that's my name.
25933,Andy,"Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve!  Ah OK, now a serious one."
25934,Pam,"Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?"
25935,Jim,"If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah."
25936,Pam,"No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him."
25937,Jim,He's just mad that we're all having fun.
25938,Pam,Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
25939,Jim,He's fine. He's indestructible.
25940,Erin,"Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages."
25941,Erin,I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
25942,Jim,Let's go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
25943,Kevin,At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
25944,Angela,"So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?"
25945,Oscar,"Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?"
25946,Oscar,What if it were salads?
25947,Kevin,"Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work."
25948,Dwight,"I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas."
25949,Jim,"OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop."
25950,Dwight,"That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up."
25951,Jim,"Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!"
25952,Pam,"Hey honey, I don't think we should push him."
25953,Jim,"Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!"
25954,Dwight,"Stop ordering me around, Jim!"
25955,Jim,What do we want?!
25956,Jim,When do we want it?!
25957,Dwight,"OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie."
25958,Jim,What are you doing?
25959,Kevin,Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
25960,Pam,Phyllis! That's not safe.
25961,Kevin,"Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it."
25962,Pam, Go up and check on him. He's upset.
25963,Jim,You know he's doing all this on purpose.
25964,Pam,Please? Just make sure he's OK? 
25965,Andy,Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! 
25966,Jim,Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
25967,Dwight,My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
25968,Jim,"Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank."
25969,Dwight,You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
25970,Dwight,That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. 
25971,Andy,"Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis.  Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok,  blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable."
25972,Andy,"It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater."
25973,Andy,"Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream."
25974,Jim,"Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant."
25975,Dwight,Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
25976,Dwight,What position did you use to conceive?
25977,Dwight,"Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim."
25978,Andy, British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
25979,Jim,"Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?"
25980,Dwight,You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
25981,Jim,"Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin.."
25982,Jim,OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
25983,Pam,Oh!  Hey! How'd it go?
25984,Jim,It's pretty good actually.
25985,Jim,We bonded. We got to- 
25986,Dwight,When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
25987,Pam,You feel OK now?
25988,Dwight,"Oh, better than OK.  You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie."
25989,Pam,"Well, actually, rhubarb is-"
25990,Pam,the one pie that I don't.
25991,Andy,I changed my mind. 
25992,Andy,"Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it.  Well, yeah, whatever. So. "
25993,Kevin,"I insult you, Oscar."
25994,Kevin,I insult you! To your face!
25995,Oscar,I don't know what you're talking about.
25996,Kevin,Then why don't you do something about it?
25997,Oscar," Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?"
25998,Kevin,"You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face!  Yes!"
25999,Pam,Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed.
26000,Andy,My name is Andy!
26001,Andy,I don't do drugs!
26002,Andy,Now check the style!
26003,Andy,Of Flatt & Scruggs!
26004,Dwight,This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
26005,Dwight, It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made.
26006,Dwight,"My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ..."
26007,Dwight,I can't get it out. Try again!
26008,Dwight,"I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin..."
26009,Dwight," Jim, no. No. No! No!"
26010,Dwight,But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
26011,Dwight,At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
26012,Erin,"Pam, what are you?"
26013,Pam,I am Dr. Cinderella.
26014,Jim,Cece's really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
26015,Pam,I'm an oncologist and you are a dog.
26016,Erin,"No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen."
26017,Erin,"Uh, Jim, you're not dressed up at all."
26018,Jim,Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys.  Can I have your sunglasses?
26019,Erin,"Jim, come on. I thought we were past this."
26020,Pam,So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
26021,Jim,"There's a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume."
26022,Pam,Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
26023,Jim,"Gettin' a lot of mileage out of this, aren't ya?"
26024,Pam,"Yeah, well, get used to it, bud."
26025,Andy,"A jitterbug.  You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?"
26026,Angela,The senator will be joining us later.
26027,Andy,"Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere."
26028,Andy,"Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!"
26029,Dwight,What lab did these little clones escape from?
26030,Andy,My Cornell a capella group.
26031,Pam,You were in an a capella group?
26032,Darryl,You went to Cornell?
26033,Andy,Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
26034,Andy,No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
26035,Andy,"You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared."
26036,Jim,Are you sure you're okay with me putting in this much money.
26037,Pam,"Yeah. I mean, listen if we're gonna do this thing, we should do it right."
26038,Pam,I kind of am. It's crazy.
26039,Jim,Okay. I'll see you in a little bit.
26040,Dwight,Jim. Look I'm eating you.
26041,Dwight,"Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims."
26042,Dwight, Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
26043,Erin, Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
26044,Dwight,"Oh no, I'm spilling Jim all over the carpet. "
26045,Erin,Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
26046,Dwight, Hello little pill. What do you do?
26047,Dwight,"Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There's a madman in our midst."
26048,Pam,Okay I give up. What are you?
26049,Pam, Gross. I love it.
26050,Dwight,This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body.  It's for a disorder of the mind.
26051,Dwight,"Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane...  They are now off their meds."
26052,Dwight,"Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me."
26053,Dwight,I'll get my apprehension kit.
26054,Andy,Ruh duh duh da dudes! What's up?
26055,Andy,"I know that it's pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that's when I became somebody. When I got the nickname ""Boner Champ,"" that is when I became me."
26056,Andy,"You didn't come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now's your chance! I'm here. You got Qs; I got As."
26057,Andy,"No, I don't have AIDS. That's not what I said. Next question."
26058,Andy,You don't have any-- Any questions about the old days?  You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
26059,Andy,Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
26060,Andy,"I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you're Boner Champ."
26061,Andy,Did you maybe tell them that or...?
26062,Andy,"Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it's really stupid, but it's also really, really, really important."
26063,Jim,"Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?"
26064,Jim,"Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we'd really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor."
26065,Jim,We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just -  - all in.
26066,Jim,All right.  Awesome. Cool.
26067,Dwight,Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
26068,Dwight,"That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?"
26069,Darryl,"I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks."
26070,Dwight,So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
26071,Darryl,Get under your chin first. Yeah.
26072,Dwight,Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
26073,Darryl,"Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah."
26074,Dwight,Is that how they like to get in?
26075,Dwight, I don't know. I just don't know.
26076,Andy,Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
26077,Andy,Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
26078,Andy,Did he tell you how I got the name?
26079,Andy,"Spring sing �95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had s*x with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way."
26080,Angela,"And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?"
26081,Oscar,"Senator Lipton, nice to see you."
26082,Angela,"Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!"
26083,Oscar,Actually I'm the electoral college.
26084,Angela,"You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!"
26085,Oscar,"I, uh, huh, just "
26086,Andy,"They didn't know about the snowman story, and when I told �em, they were not impressed."
26087,Erin,What is with these turkeys?
26088,Erin,Hey! You better do �Faith.' You get me?
26089,Erin,"So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you're like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin' song."
26090,Erin,"Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please.  This isn't stupid."
26091,Dwight,"All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill."
26092,Dwight,You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I've got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne'er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
26093,Dwight,"Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!"
26094,Dwight,"Gotcha! Yeah! Let's see ya get out of this web, huh?"
26095,Pam,"Hey, how'd it go?"
26096,Jim,"Oh man, it was great. They were great."
26097,Pam,Did you end up investing?
26098,Jim,"Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten..."
26099,Jim,Ten. It was the full ten.
26100,Jim,"Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to..."
26101,Pam,So did everybody ...
26102,Pam,Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
26103,Jim,"Um, oh man, I don't actually know."
26104,Jim,"They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, We're good with investing and then I...and I..."
26105,Andy,"Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!"
26106,Pam,They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
26107,Jim,"No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam."
26108,Pam,So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
26109,Jim,It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
26110,Pam,Talk about it now.
26111,Pam,"Jim, that was most of our savings."
26112,Pam,We said some. We said �some.'
26113,Jim,We'll talk about it later.
26114,Pam,We said part not all.
26115,Dwight,"I agree. Yes, crap. Continue."
26116,Andy,No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
26117,Andy,Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
26118,Andy,That's my signature song.
26119,Andy,"Russell, I'm dressed like George Michael."
26120,Erin,"The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic. But when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love."
26121,Andy,"You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life, okay? That's group policy and you know it."
26122,Andy,Just don't do the song anymore.
26123,Andy,"Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes."
26124,Andy,"I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!"
26125,Andy,"OK, fine, yeah. that's one guy's opinion!"
26126,Andy,Doesn't mean you're the best singer ever. Dick.
26127,Jim,I thought that concert was pretty great.
26128,Kevin,Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
26129,Angela,They lost me when they sang �Monster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
26130,Jim,"Angela, it's Halloween. You have to sing �Monster Mash'."
26131,Pam,Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
26132,Pam,"No I'm just, I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?"
26133,Jim,"Okay. We'll, just forget it."
26134,Pam,"No! No, I'm interested. I mean I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it."
26135,Jim,"Because it is Halloween. So if you're going to sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in."
26136,Pam,"Yeah, yeah, no, no. It's a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing �Monster Mash.'"
26137,Kevin,"It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates �Monster Mash.' I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!"
26138,Andy,This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
26139,Andy,"I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?"
26140,Erin,"Oh well, Andy, we're not moving to Cornell."
26141,Andy,Duh. I know. That would be insane.
26142,Andy,It could totally work though. I don't know why we wouldn't. Oh my god are we doing this?
26143,Erin,"Oy. Andy, what's going on?"
26144,Andy,"If I am not Boner Champ, I don't know who I am."
26145,Erin,"Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--"
26146,Erin,"Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor."
26147,Andy,Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
26148,Dwight,whispering] I want some of those pills.
26149,Dwight,"Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose."
26150,Dwight,Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
26151,Dwight,He says Thank you.
26152,Andy," Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there.  What?"
26153,Andy,My parents are broke.
26154,Oscar, Can you guys come with me for a minute?
26155,Oscar,"I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. ...Why?"
26156,Andy,"Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?"
26157,Andy,"White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster."
26158,Pam,Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
26159,Jim,"And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar."
26160,Pam,The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
26161,Andy,"Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so,  him."
26162,Oscar,"Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?"
26163,Kevin,"That's beautiful. No, I totally get that."
26164,Oscar,"Can you do this, Kevin?"
26165,Kevin,"I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that."
26166,Oscar,"I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-"
26167,Pam," Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you.  Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?"
26168,Pam,"Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? "
26169,Dwight,I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
26170,Dwight,"The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous?  ""Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt."" It's that easy."
26171,Andy,Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
26172,Andy,"No, it's in New Mexico."
26173,Dwight," blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle..."
26174,Dwight,"...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason."
26175,Jim,"No, you chose yourself."
26176,Dwight, Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
26177,Andy,"Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom."
26178,Andy,"Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. "
26179,Angela,Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. 
26180,Kevin,"Yeah, I think this day could get worse."
26181,Angela,What does that mean?
26182,Kevin, I don't know what you're talking about. 
26183,Erin,She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
26184,Andy,"Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?"
26185,Darryl,"If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months."
26186,Andy,"Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born."
26187,Erin,Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
26188,Darryl,I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
26189,Erin,See? I bet you wouldn't sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
26190,Darryl,I would if I owned it and I went broke.
26191,Andy,"Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat."
26192,Andy,"Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it?  Excuse me."
26193,Pam," Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so..."
26194,Pam,He's gonna be disappointed.
26195,Jim,Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
26196,Erin,"Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy.  He's seriously juvenile."
26197,Erin,"Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops."
26198,Dwight,Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds-  This is Dwight Shrute.
26199,Pam, Please hold for Ms. Black.
26200,Dwight,"Iris, thank you so much for having me."
26201,Erin, Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth. 
26202,Andy,"Uh, did you need something?"
26203,Erin,"Oh, I just need your signature on this."
26204,Angela,"Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?"
26205,Angela,I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
26206,Kevin," Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh!  I have to go to the bathroom!"
26207,Angela,That doesn't surprise me.
26208,Oscar,"That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom."
26209,Kevin,I have to go to the bathroom! 
26210,Kevin, I have to go to the bathroom!
26211,Erin,"Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?"
26212,Andy,"Look, it's not that I don't want-"
26213,Erin,"Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect."
26214,Andy,"All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said ""You can't be a skipper until you're a man."" You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance."
26215,Erin,"Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?"
26216,Erin,Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
26217,Andy,"Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now."
26218,Erin,"Ok, well then let's leave like right now."
26219,Erin,Yeah! OK! Let's go.
26220,Erin,"Of course, seriously. Get your coat on."
26221,Dwight," Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on."
26222,Dwight,"Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris."
26223,Dwight," Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather-"
26224,Angela,The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
26225,Oscar,That's a tough one.
26226,Angela,That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
26227,Angela,"Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. "
26228,Kevin," I can't, it's too much! "
26229,Oscar,I'm in big trouble.
26230,Kevin,"Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble."
26231,Dwight," OK, how is my voice now?"
26232,Dwight, This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
26233,Oscar,It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
26234,Oscar,"Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do."
26235,Dwight,"This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say!  I dare you to produce one credible source about this."
26236,Pam," Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure."
26237,Pam,No the paper's not toxic.
26238,Pam,Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
26239,Dwight,Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! 
26240,Jim,What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
26241,Dwight,Get out of here moron! 
26242,Kevin," Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?"
26243,Oscar,"I hope that's it, Kevin."
26244,Kevin,"Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that."
26245,Oscar,"Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just.."
26246,Kevin,"Oscar, we're in the middle of talking."
26247,Oscar,"Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. "
26248,Kevin,Oh that is nice. Classy move. 
26249,Dwight, That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
26250,Kevin,What are you doing?
26251,Oscar,Those figures I gave you? They're false.
26252,Oscar,"I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively."
26253,Oscar,What are you talking about? I just did this now.
26254,Oscar,That's gotta be tough.
26255,Dwight,"My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!"
26256,Andy,That's the family boat!
26257,Erin,"Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!"
26258,Erin,I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
26259,Andy,"Sure, I um..I didn't know."
26260,Erin,"Gee, he was salty."
26261,Andy,"Geez, a little bit.  How you doing old buddy? Missed you."
26262,Erin,What does that one do?
26263,Andy,It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
26264,Erin,I wish I had seen you do it.
26265,Andy,"Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me."
26266,Andy,"You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor. "
26267,Andy,"You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just-  wow."
26268,Andy,Good stuff. Nice stuff.   Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
26269,Erin,"Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat."
26270,Andy,I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
26271,Erin,"Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man."
26272,Andy,Fine. But I could have.
26273,Erin,"As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain."
26274,Andy,I am the captain.
26275,Andy,"I'm the captain.  Hey, charm school."
26276,Andy,I'm taking it over from here.
26277,Andy,"Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there."
26278,Andy,"Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?"
26279,Dwight,Please sir! Spare him. Please.
26280,Jim,"Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!"
26281,Dwight,"Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in."
26282,Erin,Do you even know what you're doing?
26283,Andy,"Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.  Walt?"
26284,Andy,I thought you were in rehab.
26285,Andy,"I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda."
26286,Andy,"Same thing.  Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on."
26287,Dwight,"David, is that you?"
26288,Dwight,"Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?"
26289,Dwight,"Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David."
26290,Dwight,"You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?"
26291,Dwight,Walk out of the house...
26292,Dwight,"...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison."
26293,Dwight," Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?"
26294,Dwight,"Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected."
26295,Kevin,"Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information."
26296,Oscar,"Well, I am sorry Kevin."
26297,Angela,Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
26298,Kevin,You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. 
26299,Angela,Honey! What are you doing here?
26300,Angela,Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
26301,Oscar,You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
26302,Kevin,"Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. "
26303,Kevin,It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
26304,Oscar,"I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control."
26305,Kevin,I totally forgot about the affair for a minute.  Oscar is having s*x with the senator and Angela doesn't even know.  Her life is a complete sham!
26306,Andy,"Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever!"
26307,Erin," Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend."
26308,Andy, Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
26309,Erin,"Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic."
26310,Andy, I'll see you in three weeks!
26311,Andy,Erin I gotta go! Them's my chords!
26312,Erin,Thanks for covering the phones.
26313,Erin,Does he have a flipper?
26314,Erin,He sounds like an idiot.
26315,Andy," Ah, what else? I've seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times. Breaks my heart every time, you know?"
26316,Andy,That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
26317,Andy,"No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull."
26318,Erin,"Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family's boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry."
26319,Andy," Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now."
26320,Darryl,"Andy, it's Darryl. Take your drawers off your head."
26321,Andy,"What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!"
26322,Erin,"Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?"
26323,Andy,"Yeah, it was. That's okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow!"
26324,Andy,"Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? "
26325,Darryl,He's been sailing for two days.
26326,Andy, I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
26327,Erin,Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
26328,Dwight," Dwight Schrute.  Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?"
26329,Dwight,And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant.
26330,Jim," Go ahead David, I'm listening."
26331,Dwight,"Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don't know where I'd put you."
26332,Dwight,"The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There's a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ""the White Whale"". Look at all that sweet blubber."
26333,Dwight,I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second.  Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley?
26334,Erin,He's in the bathroom.
26335,Dwight,Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
26336,Dwight,"Yeah! Okay.  Hey David, I'm back."
26337,Dwight,"So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?"
26338,Dwight,Shhh!  Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
26339,Dwight,Good luck to you. 
26340,Dwight,That is a damnable lie. I love women.
26341,Pam,Can you go instead?
26342,Jim,I can't. I have the thing.
26343,Jim,"I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I've ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong."
26344,Darryl,"Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?"
26345,Oscar,More like fall cleaning. 
26346,Angela, I think the senator is having an affair.
26347,Oscar, This doesn't... I'm sorry. Wha... what?
26348,Angela,I think the senator is having an affair.
26349,Oscar,I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed.
26350,Angela,"When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile."
26351,Oscar,"Oh, I'm sure ...that's nothing."
26352,Angela,And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it's Hot Yoga with Blake.
26353,Oscar,"Angela, Blake's also a guy's name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?"
26354,Oscar,I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
26355,Oscar,From you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already?
26356,Oscar,"And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out."
26357,Oscar,"Angela, I'll go with you."
26358,Dwight,"Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog."
26359,Pam,You've got this Schrute.
26360,Dwight,May I please speak to your boss?
26361,Erin,"I am? Hmm..  Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?"
26362,Dwight,"Okay, this isn't working for me, �cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss."
26363,Erin,He's absolutely right. I'm really struggling.
26364,Pam,"Oh, I'll be the buyer."
26365,Pam,"Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat."
26366,Dwight,I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
26367,Dwight,"I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over."
26368,Pam,"Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?"
26369,Dwight,I thought it went great.
26370,Jim,"Yeah, I'm here. Are we all on?"
26371,Jim," Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months..."
26372,Kevin,"That's the winter season., three months."
26373,Jim,"I uh, I have some ideas, actually..."
26374,Jim," Uh yeah. Trust me, I'd rather be with you guys."
26375,Jim,"Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh..."
26376,Jim," Um, you know what? I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell."
26377,Jim,I'm gonna try a different spot. Okay?
26378,Jim,"Okay, I'll call you right back."
26379,Kevin,What's happening in three months?
26380,Pam,"Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?"
26381,Pam,"Okay, well you have to show us."
26382,Dwight,"That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all."
26383,Dwight,What are you doing?
26384,Pam,A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
26385,Pam,"Nellie, why don't you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you're listening."
26386,Erin,"It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person."
26387,Dwight,I am a person.
26388,Dwight,That's a bit extreme.
26389,Dwight,"Okay, I'm a woman.  I'm a woman. Good?"
26390,Dwight,Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my v*g1n*.
26391,Pam,"Ten years ago, I didn't care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I'm like, that poor gimp is somebody's child."
26392,Pam,"You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women."
26393,Dwight,"Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!"
26394,Pam,"Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?"
26395,Dwight,I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
26396,Pam,"Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber."
26397,Dwight,"Okay, I can do that."
26398,Pam,Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
26399,Dwight,He used to fight dogs.
26400,Pam,"Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?"
26401,Dwight,"Little of this, little of that."
26402,Angela,Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
26403,Oscar," On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her."
26404,Angela,"Oh my God! She's so stunningly tiny! She's like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they're doing."
26405,Oscar,She's repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
26406,Angela," I've heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go."
26407,Oscar,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
26408,Oscar,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look."
26409,Jim,"What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --"
26410,Jim,The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
26411,Jim,"It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ..."
26412,Pam,"Oh, great. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don't have it."
26413,Dwight," Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it."
26414,Pam,Oh my God. It's Jan.
26415,Dwight,"Oh, dear God in heaven."
26416,Pam,"Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met."
26417,Pam,"Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?"
26418,Pam,"Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you."
26419,Dwight,Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. 
26420,Pam,"Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead."
26421,Pam,So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give?
26422,Pam,But not to us.
26423,Pam,"You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us."
26424,Dwight,"Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back."
26425,Pam,"Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?"
26426,Erin,"Sorry, I uh, just saw your face."
26427,Erin,I know. That's great. It just - it makes it look like there's an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
26428,Erin,"A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn't bad."
26429,Erin,"But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It's such a great cause."
26430,Pam,Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
26431,Pam,And it is so cute how she signs her name.
26432,Pam,"Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards �E's."
26433,Pam,"Oh, actually she can."
26434,Pam,"Um... ""A""... ""X""? I don't -- you got me."
26435,Pam, I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better.
26436,Angela," Okay, we should go now. Let's go."
26437,Oscar, Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. 
26438,Angela,Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire --
26439,Oscar, Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it.
26440,Oscar,"This could be the affair that you're scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are.  But uh, he's probably not gay. He's straight. He's straight, so..."
26441,Pam,Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
26442,Dwight,Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
26443,Dwight,"You're the Quizno's.  Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?"
26444,Pam,"Okay, you do not have to do this."
26445,Dwight,He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
26446,Jim,Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
26447,Jim,"Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out."
26448,Jim,"Uh, what does -- what does that mean?"
26449,Angela,"Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?"
26450,Oscar,"I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go."
26451,Angela,"Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?"
26452,Oscar,He's making a phone call.
26453,Pam,"Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit."
26454,Dwight,"Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings."
26455,Pam,"Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number."
26456,Dwight,"Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL."
26457,Pam,That's a license number?
26458,Dwight,"That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know."
26459,Dwight,"Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It's like air to you people. Ugh, God. "
26460,Oscar,"Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual."
26461,Angela,Oscar...  can I ask you a question?
26462,Oscar," Of course, ask me a que--  questions."
26463,Angela,Is it cool in here to you?
26464,Oscar," Yes, a little bit.  Yes."
26465,Angela,I think the thermostat is acting up again.
26466,Oscar,"It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs."
26467,Oscar,"No, thank you, Angela."
26468,Oscar,"She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love."
26469,Dwight,"Well, well, well, it's finally happened. Pam has ceased caring."
26470,Pam,These are my painting clothes.I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. 
26471,Jim,"You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?"
26472,Pam,Are you avoiding your phone call?
26473,Jim,"What? Yeah, right. As if."
26474,Jim,"Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there."
26475,Pam,"Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead."
26476,Jim,I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
26477,Pam,Tell them your opening line.
26478,Jim," Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?"
26479,Pam,I think it's good. He likes fishing.
26480,Jim,This is gonna be awful.
26481,Angela,"Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you."
26482,Dwight,"Come on in, the water's fine."
26483,Angela,"Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on."
26484,Dwight,I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. 
26485,Angela,Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
26486,Dwight,"Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?"
26487,Angela,My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
26488,Dwight," All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?"
26489,Dwight,"Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force."
26490,Angela,Can you arrange a meeting?
26491,Dwight,I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.
26492,Dwight,All we can do is sit and wait.
26493,Dwight," Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem."
26494,Jim,"I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly."
26495,Jim,"Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone."
26496,Jim,Unfair. When's my birthday?
26497,Jim,"How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?"
26498,Kevin,Make it go taller.
26499,Kevin,"No, not taller this way, taller this way. "
26500,Kevin,"You're not getting this, Peter.  Make it go wider... up!"
26501,Darryl, What are y'all doing?
26502,Kevin,Me and Pete are building a tower.
26503,Darryl,"Cool. It should be taller though, right?"
26504,Kevin,"Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer."
26505,Dwight,Get in the van.
26506,Dwight,"Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good."
26507,Angela,So what are your credentials?
26508,Angela,Do you have a gun?
26509,Dwight, Does he own a gun? Show her.
26510,Angela,You don't carry it with you?
26511,Dwight,Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?
26512,Pam," I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub."
26513,Pam,Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
26514,Pam,It's probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
26515,Darryl,That's what I'm talkin' about.
26516,Dwight,You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
26517,Angela,"Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here."
26518,Dwight,You can't have someone murdered.
26519,Angela,What if they deserved it?
26520,Dwight,"What did they do to you, Angela?"
26521,Angela,They're sleeping with my husband.
26522,Dwight,"Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you."
26523,Dwight,Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
26524,Dwight,"Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--"
26525,Angela,"No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer."
26526,Dwight,"No! You're not helping, Trevor!"
26527,Angela,"Yes, a knee-capping could work."
26528,Dwight,No. Angela! What are you saying?
26529,Angela,You said you would be there for me.
26530,Dwight,"I'm trying, but what you're asking is--"
26531,Angela,It's the only thing that will make this right.
26532,Dwight,"Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn."
26533,Jim,"You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone."
26534,Oscar,I brought you a cookie.
26535,Angela,"Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel."
26536,Oscar," I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we're good. Yeah.  We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye."
26537,Darryl,"Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play."
26538,Darryl,"Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing."
26539,Kevin,"Okay, I got this one."
26540,Kevin,"No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath."
26541,Jim,"You know, at the end of the day, it's really only two days. I mean, I'll be back in the office.  If you need me for an emergency, call me.  I'll be there..."
26542,Jim,Tell me about it.
26543,Jim,All right. You know what?  Maybe we'll just... We'll go slow.
26544,Kevin,"Nice.  Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling."
26545,Pam,I could get us a complaint.
26546,Pam,"No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try."
26547,Angela,What? Why did you call me out here?
26548,Dwight,"The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other."
26549,Angela,I don't know what you're talking about.
26550,Dwight,"Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils."
26551,Angela,Fine! It's Oscar. So what?
26552,Dwight,"Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?"
26553,Angela,"Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband."
26554,Dwight,I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
26555,Angela,"Well, you might be right. But it's too late now."
26556,Dwight,What do you mean?
26557,Dwight,"Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me."
26558,Dwight,Come -- come with me.
26559,Oscar,What are you doing?
26560,Dwight,"There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary."
26561,Kevin,I am Oscar Martinez.
26562,Angela,"No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside."
26563,Angela,"You know, there's doughnuts in the break room."
26564,Jim,"Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over."
26565,Jim,"All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that's-- that's decorative."
26566,Jim,Don't-- don't-- don't pole people with knives.
26567,Dwight,"There's no time to explain.  Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps."
26568,Oscar,"Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?"
26569,Dwight,"What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?"
26570,Oscar,I don't know what you're talking about.
26571,Dwight,"Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us."
26572,Dwight,"Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us."
26573,Dwight,"No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe."
26574,Dwight,Don't move. And disarm now! 
26575,Dwight,"No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend."
26576,Erin,"Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away from your edge!"
26577,Pam," Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, ""Hey, kool-aid."" Yeah, your mama's fat. This is Pam Halpert."
26578,Pam,"Basically I couldn't tell, but I think..."
26579,Pam,I-- I thought they were confused at least...
26580,Erin,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file.  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!"
26581,Oscar,"What the hell, Dwight?"
26582,Dwight,"See ya later, Trevor."
26583,Dwight,I just saved your life. You're welcome!
26584,Oscar,You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
26585,Angela,You deserved every bit of it!  You made my husband gay.
26586,Oscar,"What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!"
26587,Oscar,"Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me."
26588,Angela,Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
26589,Oscar,"Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe."
26590,Angela,You were supposed to be my friend.
26591,Oscar,I'm so sorry. Angela--
26592,Pam,I did not know that.
26593,Angela,I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
26594,Dwight,You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
26595,Angela," Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes!"
26596,Dwight,"I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey."
26597,Angela,I don't like your friend Trevor.
26598,Dwight,I don't like him either.  And yet I really like him.
26599,Jim,"Well, we're here. Perfect.  "
26600,Jim,"Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--"
26601,Jim,"This is hilarious, but we're gonna stop with all--"
26602,Jim,"Shuckin' the peas.  You should go back to the first part, though. You are  gonna  cover for me?"
26603,Jim,"Oh, my God, thank you.  Thank you."
26604,Pam,"If you're an artist, you have to be okay with the idea  that you can't please everybody all the time."
26605,Pam,"Shut up, Hide!  I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that."
26606,Dwight,Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
26607,Angela,My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
26608,Angela,"Well, he didn't fight me hard on it."
26609,Angela,What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
26610,Angela,Is it called red-vining?
26611,Dwight,Is it called red-vining?
26612,Dwight,We heard it was called red-vining.
26613,Dwight,Where are gay mens' vaginas?
26614,Dwight,"When two gay men have s*x, how do they know whose pen1s will open up to accept the other person's pen1s?"
26615,Jim, I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
26616,Pam,I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
26617,Jim,"Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?"
26618,Jim,"I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5:00, check into a hotel at about 6:00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking."
26619,Dwight,"Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever."
26620,Jim,"So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word ""Philadelphia""?"
26621,Dwight,"Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning ""Love,"" and adelph, meaning ""Adolf."" ""the city that loves Adolf."" Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle."
26622,Erin,"Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!"
26623,Erin,"I mean, it says ""X-Mas party,"" but I think we all know what that's code for."
26624,Kevin,"So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?"
26625,Angela,"Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee."
26626,Kevin,"Well, you are the one in charge of it."
26627,Angela,Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
26628,Oscar,"Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot."
26629,Oscar,"I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points."
26630,Kevin,"Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?"
26631,Dwight,"What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel."
26632,Jim,"Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?"
26633,Dwight,"Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular."
26634,Dwight," This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style."
26635,Jim,"I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?"
26636,Angela," Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now."
26637,Erin,"Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain."
26638,Erin,I haven't seen it.
26639,Erin,"I don't know, I just haven't."
26640,Kevin,"Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it."
26641,Kevin,"""now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho."""
26642,Erin,None of this makes any sense to me!
26643,Kevin,"Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, ""Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--"""
26644,Kevin,"Yes, you are right. Forgive me."
26645,Erin, Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
26646,Erin,"Okay, let's hear it."
26647,Erin,Die hard. Every line. Go.
26648,Erin,Don't change the subject.
26649,Jim, We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
26650,Darryl," Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man."
26651,Darryl,So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
26652,Jim,"Yeah, I think so."
26653,Darryl,Think that through for a sec.
26654,Darryl,"Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?"
26655,Darryl,What else could you possibly be forgetting?
26656,Pam,"We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us."
26657,Angela,No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
26658,Pam,What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
26659,Angela,Please just take my name off of everything.
26660,Oscar,Just take her name off of everything.
26661,Pam," The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas."
26662,Dwight,Yes! Yeah!  Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle!  Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
26663,Pam,"Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously."
26664,Pam,That there are no rules.
26665,Dwight,You have never been cooler.
26666,Dwight, And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
26667,Dwight,"That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy."
26668,Pam,What is it?  Don't touch it.
26669,Dwight, Somebody's found the hog maw.
26670,Dwight,"What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it."
26671,Dwight,"It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib."
26672,Dwight,"This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces."
26673,Oscar,How would anyone even know--
26674,Dwight,Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
26675,Jim,I don't know. Is it what you expected?
26676,Pam,I feel like --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
26677,Jim,So happy right now.
26678,Dwight," Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange.  Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump."
26679,Kevin,I wish my car had a bathroom.
26680,Erin," Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete."
26681,Erin,"I don't know. This looks pretty legit.  Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land."
26682,Erin," ""What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."""
26683,Erin,So what comes next?
26684,Erin,We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
26685,Erin,No. No more talking. It's movie time.
26686,Erin,"Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan."
26687,Kevin, I love this hog mama.
26688,Dwight," Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!"
26689,Jim,"Yes, he is finally nigh."
26690,Dwight,"Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel."
26691,Dwight,"Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo!  Ohh...Too much strudel."
26692,Jim,"So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse."
26693,Dwight,"No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel."
26694,Jim,Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
26695,Oscar," This is a real thing. ""Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany."""
26696,Dwight,"Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?"
26697,Oscar," ""His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface."""
26698,Dwight,"Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. "
26699,Darryl," Jim, that guy.  You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy?  It's awful."
26700,Dwight,Take a bowl and pass it down.
26701,Dwight,"No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable."
26702,Jim,"Oh, it's like naughty or nice."
26703,Dwight,"No, impish or admirable."
26704,Jim,"Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?"
26705,Jim,"Oh, nice. Did you check that list?"
26706,Dwight,Of course I checked it.
26707,Jim,But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
26708,Dwight,I checked it more than once.
26709,Jim,"Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--"
26710,Dwight,Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable.  There you are.
26711,Dwight,It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
26712,Dwight,"You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year ...as impish! "
26713,Oscar,Ow! You hit people with that thing?
26714,Dwight,"No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder "
26715,Dwight,"In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel."
26716,Jim,"Oh, you know what? I gotta go."
26717,Jim,"Yeah, it's all right."
26718,Dwight,"It's a punishment.  Hey, where are you going?"
26719,Jim,I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
26720,Dwight,But you work tomorrow.
26721,Jim,"Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep."
26722,Dwight,But we were gonna break the pig rib.
26723,Dwight,No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
26724,Jim,"Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody."
26725,Dwight,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?"
26726,Jim,You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
26727,Dwight,Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here!  I judge your year as impish. 
26728,Jim,Ooh! Are you nuts?
26729,Dwight, I judge you impish!
26730,Jim,"Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard."
26731,Dwight,They're not abandoning the party. 
26732,Jim," That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!"
26733,Jim, Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God.  One second. Oh...
26734,Jim,I'm probably never gonna see you again.
26735,Pam,Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
26736,Pam,I can't believe this is actually happening.
26737,Jim,"Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck."
26738,Pam,Okay.  Good luck. You're gonna be great.
26739,Jim,I'll call you when I get in.
26740,Dwight,"Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you.  And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! "
26741,Angela,Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
26742,Darryl,"Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing."
26743,Pam,"For what it's worth, I liked your party better."
26744,Dwight,"Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak."
26745,Pam,I don't think anyone thought that.
26746,Dwight,Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
26747,Pam,"Well, that didn't have anything to do with you."
26748,Dwight,I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
26749,Darryl,I'm gonna tell Jim to go  himself.
26750,Erin,Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
26751,Erin, I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
26752,Erin,But you can leave your arm.
26753,Pam,"Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?"
26754,Dwight,"No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt."
26755,Jim," Yep, I did say that."
26756,Jim,What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
26757,Jim,"What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building."
26758,Dwight, Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! 
26759,Pam,What happened? Did you miss your bus?
26760,Jim,No. I just missed my wife.
26761,Jim,And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.
26762,Dwight,Oh!  Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
26763,Darryl," Back for more, huh? "
26764,Jim,"Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog.  Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?"
26765,Jim,"Oh, hey, man.  Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview."
26766,Darryl,I shall come by at your convenience.
26767,Kevin,"To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops."
26768,Jim,I think they're going to the conference finals.
26769,Jim,"Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... "
26770,Jim,I bit my lip at lunch today.
26771,Darryl,"Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough."
26772,Kevin,"Oh, the Nets are super tough. "
26773,Jim,Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
26774,Kevin,The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
26775,Jim,"Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... "
26776,Jim,"Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!"
26777,Erin,"Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes."
26778,Pam,"Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family."
26779,Jim,"I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos."
26780,Jim, You sound tired. Everything ok?
26781,Pam,Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
26782,Jim,"Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?"
26783,Jim,"Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting."
26784,Pam,"Oh, call me later!"
26785,Jim,Love you too. Bye.
26786,Darryl,"Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so..."
26787,Darryl,"I know, I know. It's just hard."
26788,Darryl,"Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, ""What are you gonna do, breakup with me?"" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight."
26789,Darryl,"I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it."
26790,Pam,"Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today."
26791,Pam,He didn't leave me. He just went part time.  Can you just fill out the form please?
26792,Pam,"I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens."
26793,Erin," Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times."
26794,Erin,"Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!"
26795,Angela,"Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?"
26796,Dwight,"What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine."
26797,Pam,"Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly."
26798,Dwight,"Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7."
26799,Dwight,"Make way, nope, inspect me."
26800,Erin,"Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear."
26801,Dwight,Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. 
26802,Angela," Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies."
26803,Pam,"Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault."
26804,Oscar,"Pam, really? Come on."
26805,Erin,Lice. More lice.  Angela has lice.
26806,Pam,No! How? I'm so clean!
26807,Erin," Oh yeah, big time lice."
26808,Oscar,"I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith."
26809,Dwight,"It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free?  Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?"
26810,Dwight,"Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch."
26811,Darryl,"Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up."
26812,Darryl,"Yeah, she ended things."
26813,Kevin,Here man.  You need that more than me.
26814,Pam,"Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her."
26815,Angela,"Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame."
26816,Erin,No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house! 
26817,Erin,I'm trying to save you from yourself!
26818,Pam,"Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me."
26819,Jim,"Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?"
26820,Jim,"Oh no, no, no. That's ok.  Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?"
26821,Jim,You gotta be kidding me.
26822,Pam,"Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something."
26823,Pam,"Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?"
26824,Pam,Oh stop! I am so sorry!
26825,Pam,"I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this."
26826,Dwight,"Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!"
26827,Erin,"No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats..."
26828,Angela,What do we do about our heads?
26829,Dwight,I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
26830,Erin,"No, all we need is mayonnaise."
26831,Pam,"She's right, it works. I would imagine."
26832,Erin,"Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos."
26833,Oscar,"I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce."
26834,Angela,We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
26835,Erin,"Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now."
26836,Pam,"Oh! Uh, uh I'll go."
26837,Angela,"Okay. Oh, thank you."
26838,Oscar,"You're a saint, Pam."
26839,Pam,"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?"
26840,Dwight,"Let's talk pubes, people."
26841,Darryl,"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head."
26842,Kevin,"I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake."
26843,Jim,Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
26844,Jim,"Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball."
26845,Jim,"Alright.  Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?"
26846,Jim,"Right!  Hey, what's up? Everything ok?"
26847,Pam,"Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went."
26848,Jim,"It's still happening right now actually, so uh..."
26849,Pam,"He's really making you work for it, huh?"
26850,Jim,"Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?"
26851,Pam,"Great. I am killing it over here.  Jim, I gotta go."
26852,Jim,"Okay, bye.  So sorry about that."
26853,Erin," Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away."
26854,Dwight,"Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. "
26855,Dwight," Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!"
26856,Erin,"Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up."
26857,Angela,"Oscar, do you want to be my partner?"
26858,Oscar,"Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to.."
26859,Erin,"Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?"
26860,Pam,"Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?"
26861,Angela,You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
26862,Pam," Creed, I'm all done. My turn."
26863,Erin,I feel it working.  Eiffel tower!
26864,Kevin,So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
26865,Kevin,"Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever."
26866,Pam,"What, no. That can't...I don't..."
26867,Pam,"You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that..."
26868,Pam,Is there a volume knob on that thing?
26869,Dwight,Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
26870,Pam,"Meredith, I am so sorry."
26871,Angela,"Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster."
26872,Pam,I meant to say something earlier. I just...
26873,Dwight,"Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as..."
26874,Erin,"Dwight, are you okay!?"
26875,Dwight,"Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. "
26876,Erin,Wow. He got to purple.
26877,Kevin," No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay."
26878,Erin,"You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out."
26879,Erin,Okay. Okay.  Is that too cold?
26880,Kevin,I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. 
26881,Darryl,"Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do."
26882,Darryl,I'm back together with Val. Yay...
26883,Dwight,"I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. "
26884,Jim,"Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud."
26885,Jim,"No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done."
26886,Jim," This is Jim Halpert, leave a message."
26887,Pam,"Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you."
26888,Pam,I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
26889,Pam,Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
26890,Pam,"Meredith, I am so sorry about today."
26891,Pam,"I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it."
26892,Pam, This one's for all you ladies out there.
26893,Dwight,"Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family � brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew."
26894,Dwight," I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of ""Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire""."
26895,Jim,"Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy."
26896,Dwight,"Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky."
26897,Jim,"Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something."
26898,Dwight,"Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity."
26899,Dwight,"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears.  See what you leave me with here, Jim?"
26900,Jim,"Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now."
26901,Dwight,How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
26902,Jim,Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
26903,Dwight,"Mmm. That's a good... question. 300 times...  180... Um that comes to 25 minutes.  Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you."
26904,Darryl,Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company.
26905,Pam,"Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?"
26906,Darryl,Why don't you come along and tell him yourself?
26907,Pam,"Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get... What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?"
26908,Erin,"Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details."
26909,Pam,"A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order."
26910,Erin,"What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it's in order? I  haven't been trained for this."
26911,Pam," Okay, see you later."
26912,Oscar,"Hey, look who's back, Dwight Junior."
26913,Kevin,"Hey, so how was it? I mean... the s*x with Jan."
26914,Oscar,My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
26915,Oscar,"Actually, it's pronounced ""espresso""... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So..."
26916,Dwight,"There he is!  We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but..."
26917,Dwight,"Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh... No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?"
26918,Dwight,How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
26919,Dwight,Then looks like we have a deal... Son 
26920,Erin,"Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose."
26921,Erin,"I don't really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone's trust. About the pens."
26922,Pam,You ready for your interview?
26923,Darryl,"I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy's job in the bag until my interview."
26924,Pam,"Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim."
26925,Pam,"Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically Gumby with hair. "
26926,Dwight,"You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy? "
26927,Dwight," Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? "
26928,Dwight,"It was his birthday, just turned three. So..."
26929,Oscar,"You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?"
26930,Kevin,Taste test? I'm in!
26931,Oscar,"It's a thing. It means ""you only live once""."
26932,Kevin,"Yeah, we're aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it."
26933,Kevin,"Alright everybody, who's in?  Angela?  Don't make us come over there."
26934,Angela,"No, I don't... no."
26935,Angela,Can't I just agree without putting my hand in?
26936,Kevin,"Ok guys, ""we all drink them all""."
26937,Jim,"No, I hear what you're saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?"
26938,Jim,"Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago."
26939,Jim,"Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you?"
26940,Jim,What are you doing here?
26941,Pam,I just wanted to see you!
26942,Darryl,"Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!"
26943,Jim,"It's pretty great, right? I mean, we're coming along...  Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis's timeline"
26944,Jim," Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home."
26945,Dwight,"...But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy, does whatever I say."
26946,Dwight," Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son."
26947,Dwight,"What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?"
26948,Dwight, We don't get along.
26949,Dwight,"Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!"
26950,Pam,"Wow, this place is... so great. I had no idea � on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky."
26951,Jim,"Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so... These things go down all the time."
26952,Darryl,"If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it."
26953,Jim, Are you cool to just hang out?
26954,Erin,"The pen delivery went amazing, and now I've got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I'm not one of those people who's just like, ""Uh, sure. I'll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back's turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand... they are just sitting here. Pam didn't tell me not to unpack them. Don't want to be a busybody, but I don't want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it's insane! I'm sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I've never had an espresso before. They're good though."
26955,Dwight,"I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son."
26956,Dwight,"Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you."
26957,Dwight,"His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it."
26958,Dwight,"That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ""saving treats"" from the kitty litter box."
26959,Dwight,Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
26960,Dwight,"Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ""please kitty, may I have some more?"" You can't make this stuff up!"
26961,Dwight, Got cat turd collector written all over him.
26962,Darryl,"""Mandate""- Always think of two men on a date.  I have gay friends... I have one gay friend.  Oscar?"
26963,Darryl," Ummm...  Alright. Obviously y'all look really busy, and uh, I don't want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh... Obviously I'm not qualified to be here man, I'm... I'm a warehouse manager, you know..."
26964,Jim,"And as you know, I was a paper salesman.  Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. "
26965,Darryl,"Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh...  I wrote some down. There you go.  Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me! "
26966,Erin,"No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it's the truth, I swear."
26967,Kevin,"Pam! Pam, look out! Erin's gunning for your job!"
26968,Erin,"No, I'm not!  It's not like that at all! Forget it, I'm so sorry."
26969,Erin,"Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you've had."
26970,Pam,That's sweet that he talks about me.
26971,Pam,"Well, that's funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia."
26972,Dwight,Do you mind? The men are talking.
26973,Dwight,Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
26974,Dwight,"Wait, so you're the boss?"
26975,Darryl,"Yeah, yeah me too. I think it'd be like... You know what?  I think it'd be like a Kevin Durant jump shot... Perfecto!  Oh my god..."
26976,Pam,"They're the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece."
26977,Darryl,So I'm like a three year old girl in this scenario...
26978,Pam,Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
26979,Darryl,"And I'd only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I'm... I'm not so sure I'd like living in Philadelphia."
26980,Pam,Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London.
26981,Jim," Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They're going to make you pay for the fish, and... they wanted to know when you can start."
26982,Darryl,What?  How about yesterday?
26983,Pam,I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
26984,Darryl,"Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!"
26985,Pam,"No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl... Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him."
26986,Kevin,It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
26987,Oscar,It's insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
26988,Angela, I don't get the point of this stupid window!
26989,Dwight,"Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island."
26990,Dwight,"That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?"
26991,Dwight,Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too.
26992,Oscar,"Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don't we move the copier into the annex like we've always wanted to?"
26993,Oscar,"Wait!  It's beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it."
26994,Darryl,"Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That's how you do that, baby. It's all good, I'm ready. Y'all ready for this? "
26995,Oscar,"Kevin, move. I can't pull up the rug if you're standing on it with your rhinoceros feet."
26996,Kevin,Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
26997,Angela,"Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?"
26998,Oscar,Everybody shut up and work!
26999,Dwight,Yes! We did it! 
27000,Dwight,And you closed it. The boys are back in town.  High fives! Ha ha!
27001,Dwight,You got me!  I used to collect them!
27002,Dwight,"Each one is very different, like a snowflake."
27003,Pam, Hey... What happened here?
27004,Erin,"You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That's what happened. The pens happened."
27005,Pam,...Are the pens here?
27006,Dwight,"Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ""Scranton Mimeograph Corp?"" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd.  A letter from Robert Dunder. ""A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance."" The Holy Grail."
27007,Pam,: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
27008,Jim,"I think I'm a little too busy these days to s---  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail."
27009,Jim,The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
27010,Kevin,I don't get it.
27011,Dwight,A lightbulb. Okay. Okay.  Invisible ink.
27012,Dwight,"""Higher than numbers go."" The ceiling above accounting!"
27013,Angela,"Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!"
27014,Jim,": Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ..."
27015,Jim,...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
27016,Oscar,Annex. It must open something in the annex.
27017,Dwight,"""Sedes introiti."" Seat of entrance."
27018,Pam, There's nothing down here.
27019,Jim,"Oh, I expected more from young Halpert."
27020,Dwight,Let's just forget it. Forget it. 
27021,Erin,"Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack."
27022,Erin,It's just Pete in sunglasses.
27023,Erin,"And then we had him ""Like"" Dunder Mifflin."
27024,Erin,"So far, we're only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big."
27025,Erin,Pete and I work well together -- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
27026,Jim,"Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later."
27027,Jim,"Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right?"
27028,Dwight,"Pfft, ""Athlead""? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ""Stumpany,"" for ""Stupid Company."""
27029,Darryl,"Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it."
27030,Dwight,"You're working for ""Stumpany"" too?"
27031,Darryl,"Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over."
27032,Dwight," Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?"
27033,Jim,"Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity."
27034,Dwight,You won't stop until you've poached us all.
27035,Dwight,No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.
27036,Jim,Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
27037,Pam,"Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?"
27038,Kevin,"Ooh, I haven't heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?"
27039,Pam,"Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind."
27040,Angela,"I have no information. But I'm sure as soon as they know, they'll call you."
27041,Pam,"Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?"
27042,Pam,"Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital."
27043,Pam,"Hey, Cece, Daddy's gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?"
27044,Jim,Hey. I was just about to call you.
27045,Pam,"Hey, Hon, are you close?"
27046,Jim,"I am still in Philly, actually."
27047,Jim,"It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board."
27048,Pam,"Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it."
27049,Jim,"Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call."
27050,Jim,"You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?"
27051,Jim,Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
27052,Pam,"Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something."
27053,Jim,"Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone."
27054,Pam,"I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, ""Bye, Daddy."""
27055,Jim,"Bye.   Yep. See, you've still got to press ""End,"" Pam."
27056,Erin,Wow. That guy's really into paper.
27057,Erin,We did it. Youth task force forever.
27058,Erin,"No, you go -- okay."
27059,Dwight,"Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below."
27060,Dwight,"This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want."
27061,Darryl,"Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows."
27062,Dwight,"Yeah, we'll see about that."
27063,Dwight,"Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ""Infuriating, irresponsible""..."
27064,Dwight,"Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out."
27065,Dwight, Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?
27066,Kevin,"Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches."
27067,Dwight,Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
27068,Darryl,"Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It's very unlikely it would happen again."
27069,Dwight,"No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl?  L--"
27070,Darryl,Darryl is dating Val... still.
27071,Angela,"Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy."
27072,Erin,"Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy?"
27073,Angela,Yes. And he didn't like it.
27074,Kevin,"Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with?"
27075,Pam,"Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry."
27076,Pam," Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?  Oh, my God!"
27077,Pam," Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you."
27078,Pam,Shh! Kids are dancing.
27079,Dwight,"Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years.  So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?"
27080,Darryl,"Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that."
27081,Dwight,It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
27082,Dwight,"Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?"
27083,Erin,I'm just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven't done anything.
27084,Oscar,"People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?"
27085,Erin,"Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?"
27086,Kevin,Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your pen1s.
27087,Erin,"Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force."
27088,Jim,"Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--"
27089,Jim,"Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second."
27090,Pam," Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something."
27091,Darryl,I don't do that anymore.
27092,Darryl,"All right, let's get this over with."
27093,Dwight,You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo!  Here we go! Yeah!
27094,Dwight,"Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!"
27095,Darryl,How far is this place? 
27096,Dwight,"Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. "
27097,Dwight,Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
27098,Darryl,They have fast food in Philly.
27099,Darryl,It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?
27100,Dwight,"Nope.  Fire in the hole!  Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!"
27101,Dwight,"Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go."
27102,Darryl,You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
27103,Dwight,"It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming."
27104,Pam,Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital?
27105,Angela,"Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that ."
27106,Oscar,I'll watch it. Let's get this over with.
27107,Pam,"All right, you don't have to."
27108,Kevin,"Let's get this over with, Pam."
27109,Pam," Excuse me, I have to get back to work."
27110,Pam,"Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off."
27111,Oscar,User error. I've heard of that happening to other people.
27112,Angela,"Oscar, don't rub it in. I'm sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child."
27113,Pam,"Well, it was an important phone call."
27114,Pam,"I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, ""Beesly!"" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- ""Beesly!"" "
27115,Dwight, It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
27116,Darryl,You missed a spot.
27117,Dwight,"Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!"
27118,Erin,"Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea."
27119,Erin,I guess we don't have a choice.
27120,Dwight,What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
27121,Darryl,No. I was clearing my throat.
27122,Pam,"So, how's it going?"
27123,Jim,"We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it."
27124,Jim,"I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks."
27125,Pam," Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard."
27126,Jim,Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
27127,Pam,"Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all."
27128,Jim,"You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?"
27129,Pam,"No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part."
27130,Jim,"Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how."
27131,Pam,"Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it."
27132,Jim,"Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video."
27133,Pam,Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
27134,Jim,"Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it."
27135,Pam,"I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there."
27136,Jim,"You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this."
27137,Pam,You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
27138,Jim,"Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again."
27139,Jim,"I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something..."
27140,Pam,"I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want."
27141,Jim,"I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?"
27142,Pam,Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
27143,Jim,Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
27144,Pam,"What am I doing wrong, Brian?"
27145,Pam,It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard.
27146,Darryl, I'm gonna miss the paper business.
27147,Pam,"Hey Brian, you got a sec?"
27148,Erin," Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin."
27149,Pam,"Well, thanks for being a good friend."
27150,Pam,"Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa."
27151,Dwight,"That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride."
27152,Dwight,"Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did."
27153,Dwight,"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, ""Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses."" Wow."
27154,Dwight,"You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance."
27155,Dwight,"Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor � he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants."
27156,Dwight,Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
27157,Jim,"You could've just called that an alliance too, right?"
27158,Dwight,I chose my words very carefully.
27159,Jim,"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse."
27160,Dwight,"Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. "
27161,Dwight,"Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy."
27162,Pam,When are you talking to David Wallace?
27163,Jim,"I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up."
27164,Pam,Too late. My hopes are up.
27165,Jim,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix � me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys."
27166,Dwight,And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
27167,Jim,I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.
27168,Jim,I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.
27169,Jim,I'm sure he's just nervous.
27170,Pam, It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.
27171,Dwight,"So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything."
27172,Dwight,"Well, I'm the one offering the job."
27173,Dwight,I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
27174,Dwight,"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference."
27175,Dwight,"Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, ""Jump,"" and he says, ""Oh who?"" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor."
27176,Dwight,What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
27177,Dwight,"Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman."
27178,Dwight,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
27179,Dwight,There were only two options.
27180,Dwight,This is a bus transfer.
27181,Jim,"Sure, yeah, go ahead."
27182,Jim,"Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?"
27183,Jim,"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so�"
27184,Jim,"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do."
27185,Jim,Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
27186,Jim,I need you to breathe in my face right now.
27187,Jim,"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?"
27188,Jim,"I knew it, I knew it."
27189,Jim,"I looked at you coming around, and I said, ""Wintergreen."""
27190,Dwight,"I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly."
27191,Dwight,"Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party."
27192,Dwight,"Damn it! Perfect answer, again."
27193,Dwight,"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ..."
27194,Dwight,"It does, but still no."
27195,Dwight,"Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here."
27196,Oscar,Just � I don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances.
27197,Pam,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?"
27198,Darryl,They smell so bad.
27199,Kevin,"Meredith, I tell you all the time."
27200,Dwight,"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise."
27201,Dwight,What quality would make you a good sales associate?
27202,Dwight,It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
27203,Dwight,"You know we live together, right?"
27204,Dwight,"And I've never seen you go to work, ever."
27205,Dwight,So why is this on your resume? 
27206,Dwight,"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out."
27207,Angela,I don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
27208,Jim,How is it my fault?
27209,Jim,But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.
27210,Oscar,"Yeah, but Jim, Dwight's a weirdo. We can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos."
27211,Pam,"Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off."
27212,Jim,"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input�"
27213,Dwight, This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.
27214,Dwight,"Really? That's interesting. �Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately."
27215,Jim,"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife�"
27216,Jim,Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.
27217,Dwight,"Sounds fair to me, David."
27218,Jim,"Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later."
27219,Dwight,No. Why not do it now?
27220,Jim,"Uh...  Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?"
27221,Dwight,"I'd love to be in the loop, David."
27222,Jim,There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor �
27223,Dwight, I'd love to invest.
27224,Dwight,I'd like to give you $100 million.  
27225,Pam,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?"
27226,Jim,"Dwight, you can't just hire someone �cause they're your friend."
27227,Dwight,I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
27228,Dwight,You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
27229,Darryl,"Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into m*st*rb*t*ng."
27230,Dwight,"Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch."
27231,Dwight,"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of �em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof."
27232,Dwight,Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
27233,Dwight,I will pay you whatever it takes.
27234,Dwight,"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money."
27235,Dwight,Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?
27236,Dwight,"Okay. Good, good, good. "
27237,Dwight,This isn't gonna work out.
27238,Dwight,"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?"
27239,Dwight," No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. "
27240,Dwight,I do that myself now.
27241,Dwight,"No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes."
27242,Dwight,Or none of you 
27243,Dwight,I wish I could hire all of you.
27244,Dwight,"Psst. Jim Jim?  Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around."
27245,Jim,"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say."
27246,Dwight,And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
27247,Jim,But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.
27248,Dwight,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call."
27249,Jim,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
27250,Dwight,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
27251,Jim,I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
27252,Dwight,Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
27253,Jim,"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?"
27254,Dwight,Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
27255,Jim,"And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you."
27256,Dwight,What? This is such bullcrap!
27257,Jim,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say."
27258,Dwight,Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
27259,Dwight,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever."
27260,Dwight,"Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor."
27261,Dwight,"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?"
27262,Jim,All right. I think that went well.
27263,Jim,"So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out�Hey. Meet your new desk mate."
27264,Pam,"Oh, cool. Hey Clark."
27265,Jim,"Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering."
27266,Pam,"Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate."
27267,Jim,Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.
27268,Jim,I'll call you when I get there.
27269,Jim,Take care of my wife. I will be back.
27270,Dwight,They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
27271,Dwight,"Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee."
27272,Pam,"Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?"
27273,Pam,"Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that."
27274,Dwight,"Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great."
27275,Dwight,"Welcome to the club, pig! "
27276,Jim,"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does."
27277,Erin,He's around here somewhere.
27278,Erin,"Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies."
27279,Erin,"Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun."
27280,Erin, Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
27281,Darryl,How much did you pay for that?
27282,Erin,"Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe."
27283,Darryl,"Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it."
27284,Erin," Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guy's hilarious. He's here today. "
27285,Pam,"I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together...  Oh my god!  Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way!"
27286,Angela,"Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house."
27287,Erin,"Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids."
27288,Angela,"No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors."
27289,Kevin,"Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping...  8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation..."
27290,Angela,"No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about."
27291,Oscar," Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too."
27292,Oscar,He said he wanted me there for support.
27293,Angela,I'm his! His... wife.
27294,Oscar,"Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today.  Me."
27295,Angela," We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too."
27296,Jim,We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
27297,Darryl,"Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates."
27298,Jim,"And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down."
27299,Darryl,Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
27300,Darryl,Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
27301,Jim,"And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?"
27302,Darryl,"I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to  soak... He hooked me up with a job."
27303,Pam," Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice."
27304,Pam,"I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian."
27305,Jim,"Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients."
27306,Darryl,Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
27307,Jim, Who is this guy? We are killing it.
27308,Pam, Conference room. Everybody. Now!
27309,Dwight,You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
27310,Pam,"Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting."
27311,Dwight,"You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?"
27312,Dwight,"Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!"
27313,Pam, I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
27314,Erin,I thought that's what you were doing.
27315,Pam,"Yeah, but this is different."
27316,Erin,Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
27317,Pam,"I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So..."
27318,Erin,I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
27319,Pam,"Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped."
27320,Oscar,"Pam, what can be done?"
27321,Pam,Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.
27322,Oscar,I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
27323,Pam,What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
27324,Pam,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art."
27325,Pam," No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go."
27326,Dwight,"Pam, I'll help you."
27327,Dwight,"If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime."
27328,Pam,"I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car."
27329,Dwight, You need my pitchfork?
27330,Dwight,What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
27331,Angela,"Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you."
27332,Dwight,"Ah, I'm not interested."
27333,Angela,What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
27334,Dwight,"If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. "
27335,Kevin,"Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?"
27336,Kevin,"OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money."
27337,Dwight," I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own."
27338,Dwight,"Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts."
27339,Dwight,Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
27340,Dwight,"Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts..."
27341,Pam,"We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him."
27342,Dwight,We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him.  Nate. Your mother is dying. 
27343,Pam,"See, I feel bad about that."
27344,Dwight,It's all right. It's all right.
27345,Dwight,No. She needs her rest again.
27346,Dwight,"You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum."
27347,Pam, Tell us who defaced the mural!
27348,Pam,All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
27349,Dwight,There's no gum. There never was any gum.
27350,Kevin," Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck."
27351,Oscar, That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
27352,Angela," Oh, Robert, you're horrible.  Simon, Maxine.  Who let you guys in here?"
27353,Jim," What?  Oh, man! I'm sorry about that."
27354,Darryl,It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
27355,Jim,"Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?"
27356,Darryl,That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
27357,Jim,"Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that."
27358,Darryl,No big deal. No big deal.
27359,Jim,"No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal."
27360,Darryl," Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that."
27361,Jim,"Honestly, I don't mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or..."
27362,Darryl,I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
27363,Jim, OK. Here ya go. 
27364,Pam," Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn."
27365,Pam,"Well, I didn't think that butt was funny."
27366,Pam,Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
27367,Pam,That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
27368,Dwight,"Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first."
27369,Pam,We should just take him down.
27370,Dwight,Wait. Are you saying...
27371,Pam,I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
27372,Dwight,"Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt."
27373,Dwight,He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
27374,Dwight,A little eye for an eye action.
27375,Dwight,Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
27376,Pam,We need an infiltrator.
27377,Dwight,I know just the man for the job. 
27378,Dwight,He even looks like a mole.
27379,Oscar,One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
27380,Oscar,"Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian."
27381,Darryl,I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
27382,Jim, It's mine. Don't worry.
27383,Darryl,I didn't say anything.
27384,Jim,I don't think you had to.
27385,Jim,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?"
27386,Darryl,"What you need flour for, Jim?"
27387,Jim,That's not the point.
27388,Darryl,What? You making bread?
27389,Jim,"No, I'm not making bread."
27390,Darryl,What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
27391,Jim,"Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make."
27392,Darryl,"All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all."
27393,Jim,It's all good. Are we all good?
27394,Darryl,Nothing.  It's mine.   What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
27395,Jim,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?"
27396,Dwight, I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
27397,Dwight,"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work."
27398,Pam,Shh. Remember your lines.
27399,Dwight,Go move some paper!
27400,Pam," Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?"
27401,Darryl,"He's not my hire, but I know who he is."
27402,Pam,OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
27403,Darryl,What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
27404,Pam,"Yeah, something like that."
27405,Darryl,I know he loves his pick up truck.
27406,Pam,"Oh, great!  His truck!"
27407,Dwight,Great. Get the plate number.
27408,Pam,OK.  Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
27409,Dwight,So we know which truck to van...
27410,Darryl,"Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?"
27411,Pam,Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on. 
27412,Oscar,He put me here.
27413,Angela,He put you right in front of me?
27414,Pam,I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
27415,Dwight,"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita."
27416,Pam,"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet."
27417,Pam,"Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid."
27418,Dwight,This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
27419,Pam,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
27420,Dwight,I saw that. That's great!
27421,Pam,Yeah. I feel better.
27422,Dwight,"Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch."
27423,Pam,"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?"
27424,Dwight,Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his pen1s.
27425,Pam,"I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very..."
27426,Pam,"o, you had no right!"
27427,Pam,So? You started it!
27428,Oscar,Yes. Sorry about that.
27429,Angela,It was all my fault.
27430,Kevin,"Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck."
27431,Kevin,"You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. "
27432,Pam,"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers."
27433,Pam,"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me."
27434,Pam,Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
27435,Pam,"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry."
27436,Jim,"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'."
27437,Jim, You win.  How good did that feel?
27438,Darryl,"That felt really good, actually."
27439,Pam, Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
27440,Jim,"It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday."
27441,Jim,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week."
27442,Pam,"And, poof! He disappears. "
27443,Erin, Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
27444,Erin,We can do anything you want.
27445,Erin,"I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend."
27446,Erin, Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
27447,Dwight," Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract."
27448,Dwight," I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo."
27449,Dwight,"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow.  Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown."
27450,Kevin,"Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk."
27451,Kevin,"OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip."
27452,Angela,They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed.  They use a watch repair kit.
27453,Kevin, Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
27454,Oscar,"Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the..."
27455,Darryl,"No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that."
27456,Oscar,"All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my..."
27457,Darryl, Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
27458,Pam,"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill."
27459,Jim,Oh my god. That's so romantic.
27460,Pam,It's with Brian and Alyssa.
27461,Jim,Oh my god. That's less romantic.
27462,Pam,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life."
27463,Jim,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?"
27464,Jim,"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy."
27465,Oscar, Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
27466,Oscar,We are together. Romantically.
27467,Darryl,"Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. "
27468,Pam,He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
27469,Jim,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy."
27470,Pam,"Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him."
27471,Dwight, I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
27472,Dwight, Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
27473,Dwight,You're back.  And you're disgusting.
27474,Andy,"Well, well, well, look who it is."
27475,Andy,"I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived."
27476,Andy,Hey! Sweetheart!  I have missed you so much.
27477,Erin," Yes.  Welcome back, buddy."
27478,Andy, I have been dreaming of this moment.
27479,Erin,Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
27480,Erin,"I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something."
27481,Oscar,What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
27482,Andy,"Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something.  Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this.  Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. "
27483,Dwight,"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour."
27484,Andy,"Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.  But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting."
27485,Dwight,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?"
27486,Andy,"I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe."
27487,Erin,He only emailed me four times.
27488,Andy,For two hours? Really?
27489,Oscar,"So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?"
27490,Andy,If the shoe fits. 
27491,Jim,"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight."
27492,Andy,I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
27493,Andy,And you sold it to Jan too.
27494,Andy,I mean... I'm impressed.
27495,Andy,"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight."
27496,Dwight,You were on a boat.
27497,Andy,OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio?  Just say the word 'coolio'.
27498,Dwight,I'm not gonna say it.
27499,Dwight,No!  What do you think you're doing?
27500,Andy,Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
27501,Dwight,Don't you dare! Andy!
27502,Andy,"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here."
27503,Andy,I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
27504,Andy,Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
27505,Andy,"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood."
27506,Andy,"It, it's, it's actually just an issue..."
27507,Dwight,"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything."
27508,Andy,"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but..."
27509,Andy,Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
27510,Andy," Hey, everybody, great job.  Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks."
27511,Angela,"Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays. "
27512,Andy,All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Who's that little fella?
27513,Angela,It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
27514,Oscar,A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
27515,Andy,"Uh-huh...  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed."
27516,Dwight,Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
27517,Kevin,"He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?"
27518,Dwight,"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months."
27519,Dwight,"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf."
27520,Erin,"Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands."
27521,Dwight,"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway."
27522,Andy," What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy!  All right. Back to work."
27523,Pam,"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?"
27524,Jim,"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy."
27525,Pam,I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
27526,Jim,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you."
27527,Pam,It's not Brian's fault.
27528,Jim,"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it."
27529,Andy,I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
27530,Dwight,"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages."
27531,Andy,"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?"
27532,Andy,"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do."
27533,Andy, We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
27534,Kevin,"You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank..."
27535,Dwight, ... lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
27536,Andy,There was a fire in the warehouse?
27537,Dwight,The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
27538,Andy,"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?"
27539,Andy,Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.
27540,Andy,"Good, good. What else?"
27541,Andy,"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire."
27542,Andy,The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
27543,Andy," I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire."
27544,Andy,I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
27545,Erin,"Really playing the scales, huh?"
27546,Andy,"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?"
27547,Erin,I don't love you anymore.
27548,Erin,"I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you."
27549,Andy,"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here."
27550,Erin,I just said there isn't love.
27551,Andy,"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time."
27552,Andy,"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun."
27553,Erin,You got really sunburned.
27554,Andy,"I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years."
27555,Andy,"I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again."
27556,Erin,You really think we can get that back?
27557,Andy,Yes.  Come on. Totally.
27558,Jim,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
27559,Jim,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?"
27560,Jim,I just feel like we're gonna fight.
27561,Jim,So... how 'bout let's not?
27562,Jim,"Oh, um.  Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it."
27563,Pam, Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
27564,Pam,I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
27565,Jim,You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
27566,Jim,"OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly."
27567,Erin,I couldn't do it.
27568,Erin," We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months."
27569,Andy,"I resent that. I, I never lied to you."
27570,Andy,And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
27571,Andy,"Oscar says ""hi"" all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. ""Hi"" ""Hello"" ""Hola"" You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say ""hi""?"
27572,Andy,But you're calling me a liar.
27573,Andy,"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately."
27574,Andy,"Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.  ""Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick."" Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!"
27575,Andy,This has been a really tough time.
27576,Andy,"Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard."
27577,Andy,It was like a security blan-
27578,Andy,"David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it."
27579,Andy,Vanilla.  Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
27580,Andy,And how are you on this fine- 
27581,Andy," Ok, we ready?  Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up."
27582,Pam,He sounds like a wounded animal.
27583,Erin,Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
27584,Pam," Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you."
27585,Pam,"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note."
27586,Dwight," No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do."
27587,Dwight,"And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes."
27588,Angela,What? What is it?
27589,Dwight,"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs."
27590,Dwight,"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ""poisoned"" by Aunt Shirley."
27591,Angela,"What do you mean by ""poisoned""?"
27592,Dwight,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was."
27593,Angela,"Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt."
27594,Angela,But I don't see how this is my problem.
27595,Dwight,"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-"
27596,Dwight,And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
27597,Dwight,"There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap."
27598,Dwight,"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?"
27599,Angela,"Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-"
27600,Dwight,"..where it was and it needs, it needs a..."
27601,Andy,Where are you going?
27602,Pam,"Uh, not on a three month boat trip."
27603,Andy,"Wha? Oh, burn.  Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?"
27604,Andy,I'm still the boss!
27605,Andy,The answer is yes.
27606,Erin,..just have some messages for you.
27607,Andy,Are they from you?
27608,Erin,"Well no, they're from clients."
27609,Andy,"Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it."
27610,Andy,"Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing."
27611,Erin,These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
27612,Andy,I don't want to talk about work right now.
27613,Erin,Well I only want to talk about work right now.
27614,Andy,Then I want my big blue sweater back.
27615,Erin,"Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army."
27616,Andy,She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
27617,Andy,"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first."
27618,Andy,"Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?"
27619,Andy,Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
27620,Andy,"May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. "
27621,Dwight,"Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight."
27622,Dwight,"This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!"
27623,Dwight,"You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit."
27624,Angela,Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
27625,Dwight,"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?"
27626,Dwight,"It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find."
27627,Andy,"Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places."
27628,Andy,"I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen."
27629,Oscar,That's her private property.
27630,Andy,"Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?"
27631,Oscar,Andy. That is her private property.
27632,Andy,"Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone."
27633,Darryl,"Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated."
27634,Andy,Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
27635,Jim,Hey! There she is.  How you doin?
27636,Pam,"Hi! Hey, do I look ok?"
27637,Pam, What's that? Is that a-
27638,Jim,"Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. "
27639,Pam,"How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear."
27640,Pam,"Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it."
27641,Jim,"You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you."
27642,Pam,"Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me."
27643,Jim, Call you right back. What were you saying?
27644,Jim,"I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck!"
27645,Angela,"Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly."
27646,Dwight,"In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night."
27647,Dwight,"Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down."
27648,Dwight,"No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic."
27649,Andy,"Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted  shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?"
27650,Andy,You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
27651,Andy,No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
27652,Andy,"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry.  So you had a bad day-"
27653,Andy,..The camera don't lie!
27654,Andy,You're being an idiot get..
27655,Andy,"Out of my office, turns out you're fired..."
27656,Andy,So you had a bad day...
27657,Andy,Rut ti doh doh...
27658,Andy,Rut tit doh doh...
27659,Andy,Rut ti doh doo doh
27660,Andy,Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
27661,Andy,"They already have a contract?  ""Mutually agree to-"" Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch."
27662,Andy,"Well, I'm not signing away my rights."
27663,Andy,"Ok, well we'll see about that. "
27664,Pam,Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
27665,Dwight,"It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose."
27666,Angela,You have to use chains?
27667,Dwight,You'll see. Here we go.
27668,Dwight,Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
27669,Dwight,Let's get to it.
27670,Dwight,Give it a whirl.
27671,Angela,"Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal."
27672,Dwight,I need you to hose my aunt.
27673,Dwight,OK you are useless.
27674,Dwight,Give me the hose!
27675,Angela,"No Dwight, I won't- "
27676,Angela, I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
27677,Andy,"Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend."
27678,Andy,That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
27679,Darryl,You've got a booger bubble going on there.
27680,Andy,My whole life is a booger bubble!
27681,Pam,"Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-"
27682,Pam,"Oh, cause it was upside down. "
27683,Pam,"Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-"
27684,Andy,Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: pen1s. Translation? My manhood.
27685,Andy,"Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now."
27686,Erin,"Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear."
27687,Andy,Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
27688,Erin,See? We can all be friends!
27689,Erin,"Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward."
27690,Andy,"Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun."
27691,Pam,I am not pr-
27692,Pam,I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
27693,Pam,"So, kinda like a receptionist."
27694,Pam,"I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't."
27695,Angela,Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
27696,Angela,"I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way."
27697,Darryl,Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
27698,Jim,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
27699,Pam,"Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-"
27700,Jim,"I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in."
27701,Jim,"I'll make it worth your while, I promise."
27702,Pam,"Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight."
27703,Erin,Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
27704,Erin,"Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way."
27705,Erin,"Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk."
27706,Erin,"What, do you two know each other?"
27707,Erin,Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. 
27708,Kevin,Didn't you two used to do it?
27709,Andy,"Hi, how's it going?"
27710,Andy,Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
27711,Andy,"It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta ""move on"". Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. "
27712,Erin,So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
27713,Dwight,And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
27714,Angela,You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
27715,Dwight,By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
27716,Dwight,Would you like the stink sack?
27717,Angela,Is it any good?
27718,Dwight,"No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack."
27719,Angela,"Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends."
27720,Pam,"Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?"
27721,Pam,"Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job."
27722,Jim,Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
27723,Pam,"Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate."
27724,Jim,Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
27725,Pam, You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
27726,Jim,"Alright. So, tell me all about it."
27727,Dwight,"Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you."
27728,Angela,"It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Dwight, Dwight."
27729,Dwight,"Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse."
27730,Angela,"No, Dwight. The Senator."
27731,Dwight,"Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey."
27732,Angela,"I can't be your monkey, Dwight."
27733,Dwight,I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
27734,Angela,I made a vow. I gave my word.
27735,Dwight,Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
27736,Erin,How are you doing? Is it really rough?
27737,Andy,"Hey, love turds. Conference room, now."
27738,Andy,Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
27739,Andy,"Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?"
27740,Andy,"And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch."
27741,Erin,"Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?"
27742,Andy,"We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?"
27743,Erin,"Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican."
27744,Erin,I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
27745,Erin,"Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-"
27746,Erin,He didn't even say that.
27747,Erin,What is that supposed to mean?
27748,Erin,I don't want you to shave everything.
27749,Andy,"Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better?  Yeah. Yeah, it does."
27750,Pam,"So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura."
27751,Jim,Tell me about the cologne. How much?
27752,Pam,"Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least."
27753,Jim,You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
27754,Pam,Guess what poster he had on his wall?
27755,Pam,MmMm. You're getting colder.
27756,Jim,Not Night at the Roxbury.
27757,Pam, No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
27758,Jim,"I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?"
27759,Pam,"I don't know, but it's interesting right?"
27760,Pam,He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
27761,Jim,"That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?"
27762,Jim,"So, next interview has to be better."
27763,Jim,What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
27764,Pam,"I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this."
27765,Jim, Huh. This is a little out of left field.
27766,Pam,"Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton."
27767,Jim,And I have started a business in Philadelphia. 
27768,Oscar,"You could all be doing this, just saying."
27769,Oscar,"I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online."
27770,Oscar,"I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright  Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?"
27771,Kevin,"Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?"
27772,Oscar,Can someone please help me?
27773,Oscar,"Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me?  I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good.  Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?"
27774,Erin,"Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are."
27775,Dwight,I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
27776,Pam,"Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?"
27777,Dwight,"I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother."
27778,Dwight,My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
27779,Jim,"OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?"
27780,Dwight,"In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil."
27781,Erin, What color is it?
27782,Kevin," Yep. Acidic, all right."
27783,Oscar,"I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session..."
27784,Oscar,I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
27785,Jim, I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
27786,Dwight,I really hope so. 
27787,Jim,OK.  This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
27788,Dwight,I miss her so much.
27789,Dwight, Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
27790,Dwight, What are you doing here?
27791,Oscar,You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
27792,Oscar,You have a brother?
27793,Pam,"Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology."
27794,Pam,I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
27795,Pam,"Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake."
27796,Dwight,Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
27797,Dwight,"Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies."
27798,Dwight,"Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies."
27799,Dwight,You had black hair and then gray hair.
27800,Oscar,They're a descriptive people.
27801,Dwight,"You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?"
27802,Oscar,Dwight has a sister?
27803,Dwight," Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years.  What is this? Oh, god.  Henry."
27804,Dwight,I see Esther's back in town.
27805,Dwight,Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
27806,Dwight,"Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens."
27807,Dwight,"So, let's get it going."
27808,Dwight,"We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness."
27809,Oscar, That's it for me. 
27810,Pam,I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
27811,Pam,"We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?"
27812,Pam,Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
27813,Angela,Do they even have a bakery anymore?
27814,Kevin,"They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day."
27815,Pam,"So, it really is just about the cupcakes."
27816,Andy,"Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes."
27817,Dwight,"I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich."
27818,Dwight,Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
27819,Dwight,Of course you are.
27820,Dwight,You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
27821,Dwight,"You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes."
27822,Dwight," People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck."
27823,Angela," Kevin, you can do this."
27824,Kevin,You don't know that.
27825,Pam,"Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?"
27826,Kevin,James Bond was a spy.
27827,Pam,Yes. He was a good spy.
27828,Kevin,Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
27829,Pam,"Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing.  Hey!"
27830,Angela,He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
27831,Pam,"No, no. It's the principle of the thing."
27832,Andy," Oh my god. I forgive him so much.  Whoa, is he choking?"
27833,Kevin," Oh, that was fantastic."
27834,Dwight,"Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens."
27835,Dwight,"Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit."
27836,Dwight,"This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking."
27837,Dwight,Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
27838,Dwight,Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
27839,Dwight,"Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?"
27840,Dwight,"OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?"
27841,Pam,"Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK."
27842,Angela,Some of us got both. 
27843,Pam,Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
27844,Andy,"Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know.  Na, nothing really. Kevin?"
27845,Kevin,Why would you ask me?
27846,Andy,"I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know.  Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um.  Pretty normal night."
27847,Kevin, My night was just like that.  Meaning normal.
27848,Andy,Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. 
27849,Kevin,Nope. I did not see you either.
27850,Pam,Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
27851,Kevin,"Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand."
27852,Darryl,"That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage."
27853,Jim,"Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too."
27854,Dwight,"It.  That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that."
27855,Kevin,Uh oh. She's doing it again.
27856,Pam,"Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um..."
27857,Dwight," Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment."
27858,Darryl,"Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public."
27859,Pam,"Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit."
27860,Dwight,Phyllis is m*st*rb*t*ng. In the office right now as we speak.
27861,Angela,Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
27862,Oscar,"Toby, how do you propose that we-"
27863,Andy,"hoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?"
27864,Pam,She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
27865,Andy,Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
27866,Dwight,"OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. "
27867,Dwight,"It's OK guys, she's no longer horny."
27868,Andy,"Excuse me, dirty birdie "
27869,Andy,You can have this back at the end of the day.  Oh!!
27870,Dwight,"Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles."
27871,Dwight,Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
27872,Dwight,"Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me."
27873,Dwight, What do you think?
27874,Dwight,A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
27875,Angela,"Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes."
27876,Angela,Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! 
27877,Pam, Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
27878,Pam,I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
27879,Jim,"Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen."
27880,Jim,What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
27881,Pam,You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
27882,Jim,"Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman."
27883,Jim,"Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?"
27884,Pam,"Yeah, sounds good. Ok."
27885,Kevin," What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?"
27886,Oscar,There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
27887,Kevin,Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
27888,Kevin,"This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo."
27889,Kevin, Did you see this? 
27890,Angela,Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
27891,Pam,It wasn't so bad.
27892,Andy,"Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. ""Banjo at 0:19 is aight"" Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?"
27893,Jim,"Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert."
27894,Jim,Let's go to the conference room.
27895,Dwight,"Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots."
27896,Angela,I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
27897,Dwight,Did I tell you about her teeth?
27898,Erin,"Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper."
27899,Dwight,"Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome."
27900,Dwight,"Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always."
27901,Angela,"I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing."
27902,Pam,Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
27903,Jim,"With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number."
27904,Darryl,"And we all know, baseball does not last forever."
27905,Jim,"Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical."
27906,Darryl,The space dust does it.
27907,Jim,"Sure, yeah.  Hollywood.  Alright."
27908,Darryl,"Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it."
27909,Kevin,"Andy, are there documentary groupies?"
27910,Andy,Of course there are!
27911,Oscar,"Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark."
27912,Kevin,"What was that word they said when they showed me ""Skrald mand""? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? "
27913,Angela,"What about me? ""Klokken tre pige"""
27914,Angela,"What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that?  Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!"
27915,Oscar,It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
27916,Angela,"There was much more secret filming than I expected.  But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am."
27917,Oscar,Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
27918,Oscar,"Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!"
27919,Oscar,I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
27920,Oscar,"I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you?"
27921,Andy,"People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: ""You guys are killing it!"" I mean, we're internet sensations guys!"
27922,Angela,I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
27923,Oscar,"Ok everyone, turn off your mikes."
27924,Angela,We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
27925,Erin,I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?
27926,Pam,"Yeah, I guess I could."
27927,Dwight,"Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal."
27928,Dwight,"Ok ok ok, wait! You win. "
27929,Andy,"Oh! Seven new comments. ""The guy at 0:19 is hawt!""  ""Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!"" ""He's not hawt, he's gay.""  ""Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.""  ""He is hawt!"" See, thank you, that's more like it. ""He is butt."" God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!"
27930,Dwight,Security deposit. That's been-
27931,Dwight,I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
27932,Dwight,"What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off."
27933,Dwight,What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
27934,Dwight,No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
27935,Dwight,I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. 
27936,Pam,"Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?"
27937,Pam,"Oh my gosh, please, don't."
27938,Pam,"OK.  Oh wow, you have a nice view."
27939,Angela," Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?"
27940,Oscar,They caught us kissing on Halloween.
27941,Angela,Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! 
27942,Oscar,Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
27943,Angela,Oh!  Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
27944,Oscar,"Well, I don't like giving him bad news."
27945,Angela,Call him! Call him!
27946,Pam,"Well, the promo for the documentary aired today."
27947,Pam,Yeah. It's kinda crazy.
27948,Pam,"See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?"
27949,Pam,"Yeah, wasn't that neat?"
27950,Pam,"Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?"
27951,Pam,I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
27952,Pam,"I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?"
27953,Pam,"Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out.  Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-"
27954,Pam,"You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much."
27955,Pam,How much stuff you got.
27956,Pam,"Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?"
27957,Pam,So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
27958,Pam,"Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go."
27959,Pam,No I think you explained it.
27960,Jim,"""Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh."""
27961,Jim,"""Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks."""
27962,Jim," ""Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!"""
27963,Jim,"""Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you."""
27964,Jim,"Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends."
27965,Jim,"""Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack."""
27966,Jim,I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
27967,Darryl,We can look into it.
27968,Jim,We'll look into it.
27969,Jim,We gotta get him.
27970,Darryl,We'll go after Darth then.
27971,Jim,We're gonna go get him.
27972,Darryl,That's what we gotta do.
27973,Jim,We're gonna get him.
27974,Dwight,Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
27975,Dwight,Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
27976,Dwight,"I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther."
27977,Dwight,That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
27978,Dwight,"So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?"
27979,Angela,No you go. Hi honey!
27980,Angela,It's Angela and Oscar.
27981,Angela,Just a few quick things.
27982,Oscar,"Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos."
27983,Angela,Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
27984,Oscar,"Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay."
27985,Angela,"Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it."
27986,Oscar,I think that's it!
27987,Angela,I think we're good.
27988,Andy, Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. 
27989,Andy,"Huh? Yeah, see ya.  Oh! What?! "
27990,Pam,I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. 
27991,Erin,Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon!  Come on Stanley! 
27992,Erin,"Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a... ""Mageddon!"""
27993,Erin,"Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!"
27994,Oscar,Our office has an unusually large number of... unusually large people.
27995,Erin,Come on. You got this. Here.
27996,Oscar,"So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time."
27997,Andy,"Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in."
27998,Andy,I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There's a review of the documentary!
27999,Andy,"I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, ""Red Alert."""
28000,Dwight,"Well, the alert was already set to ""Red"" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ""Double Red""?"
28001,Andy,I think we should.
28002,Oscar,"""The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton's own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!"""
28003,Dwight,What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news...thing.
28004,Andy,It's okay.  The hell does he know?
28005,Andy,I want you to print that out for me.
28006,Andy,"Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb."
28007,Erin,"""Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values."""
28008,Erin,I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years.
28009,Dwight,"Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go."
28010,Dwight,"The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order."
28011,Pam,"Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks."
28012,Pam,"Oh, nothing that exciting."
28013,Pam,"You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help."
28014,Pam,"I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right?"
28015,Jim,"Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question."
28016,Jim,"It's a little, uh, personal."
28017,Jim,I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
28018,Jim,"Sorry. I�no, no, no, what I meant�what I meant actually was�"
28019,Jim,You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
28020,Jim,Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling.
28021,Jim,"No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better."
28022,Andy,"Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. "
28023,Angela,"Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey.  Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls."
28024,Angela,"All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that. "
28025,Dwight,Andy� I need to talk to you.
28026,Andy,"Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!"
28027,Dwight,Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
28028,Andy, I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final.
28029,Dwight,"So what I'm hearing you say is, ""Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible""?"
28030,Andy,"Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent."
28031,Andy, Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
28032,Dwight,"For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts."
28033,Dwight,"Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale."
28034,Dwight,"Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker."
28035,Dwight,It's all right. Andy approved it.
28036,Dwight,"Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do."
28037,Dwight,Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.  Grab his feet.  Let's go!
28038,Dwight,"Move it! One, two, three. "
28039,Dwight,"He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three!  Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain."
28040,Dwight," Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!"
28041,Dwight,I might see a movie.
28042,Dwight,"Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?"
28043,Dwight,"Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before."
28044,Dwight,"Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh..."
28045,Dwight,I know. Evel Knievel.
28046,Dwight,"Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him."
28047,Dwight,"You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's only�"
28048,Dwight,"It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine�"
28049,Dwight,Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
28050,Jim,"So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or..."
28051,Pam,"He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that."
28052,Jim,"If I didn't do certain things without telling Pam, she'd be married to Roy. "
28053,Pam,"I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up."
28054,Jim,"If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I�this will be so huge for our family."
28055,Jim,What do you mean?
28056,Jim,That's kind of an impossible question.
28057,Erin,"Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry!"
28058,Kevin,"Ooh, there's Angela! I work with her!"
28059,Andy,"Huh, yeah.  I mean, I'm happy Angela's the first one getting famous, but it's a little weird, no? I mean, she can't sing or act, so it's actually kind of insane, if you think about it."
28060,Andy,"Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star! "
28061,Erin,Oscar is with the Senator too?
28062,Kevin,"Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew! "
28063,Kevin,"Yes, we did it!"
28064,Oscar,"You did it, Kevin."
28065,Kevin,"Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it."
28066,Dwight,Almost there. Almost there.  Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
28067,Dwight,Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
28068,Dwight,Let's get him inside.
28069,Andy,"Carla Fern is not just an actor's agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate."
28070,Andy,"Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?"
28071,Andy,Does anything go on top of the mouse?
28072,Andy,What's the mouse's name?
28073,Dwight,"Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters."
28074,Dwight,Hoist his shank on three.
28075,Dwight,It's by the tenderloin.
28076,Dwight,"Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can you�sl-slouch him into the seat.  Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. "
28077,Dwight, Get in the back.
28078,Dwight,Get in the back.
28079,Dwight,"Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?"
28080,Dwight,"Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson."
28081,Dwight,"New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go."
28082,Pam,"I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly."
28083,Jim,"Well, if Pam says she won't go, then� we're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph."
28084,Dwight,"And for�oh, whoopsie daisy. "
28085,Dwight,He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
28086,Dwight,"It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?"
28087,Dwight,Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child.
28088,Dwight,"Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis."
28089,Andy," Well, what can't I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent."
28090,Andy,"At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here."
28091,Andy,"My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal's going out on."
28092,Andy,"Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility.  I'm all for it."
28093,Andy,"Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much."
28094,Andy,"You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me."
28095,Andy,"Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots."
28096,Andy,It doesn't include headshots.
28097,Andy,"Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though."
28098,Dwight,"You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs."
28099,Dwight, We need a winch and a hoist.
28100,Erin,I did. I got some really good sleep.
28101,Dwight,"Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean.  Practically made of plastic."
28102,Pam,"I didn't see you! You should have yelled ""Crossing!"""
28103,Pam,"Ok, so is that my spot?"
28104,Andy," Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!"
28105,Darryl,It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
28106,Andy,Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
28107,Andy,"Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two."
28108,Andy,"Go away, we're running lines."
28109,Andy,"Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow.  Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go."
28110,Andy,"Yeah, Ok.  Alright. Where were we?"
28111,Darryl,Something full of acid.
28112,Andy,And remember: Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
28113,Darryl," That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here."
28114,Andy,W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
28115,Jim,Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
28116,Pam,Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
28117,Pam,"So, we had couple's therapy."
28118,Jim,No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
28119,Pam,And we have homework.
28120,Jim,"Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly."
28121,Pam,And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
28122,Pam,"Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy."
28123,Jim,"Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do ""opportunities."""
28124,Andy,"Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig."
28125,Andy,"Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator."
28126,Oscar,Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
28127,Andy,Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
28128,Erin,Clark's a dead man.
28129,Angela,Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
28130,Erin,"Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously."
28131,Angela,"Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine  for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens."
28132,Angela,"Come here, come here. Let's go."
28133,Angela,"I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer."
28134,Dwight,"I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent."
28135,Erin,Hey. Why don't you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
28136,Erin,"Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix."
28137,Andy,"No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage."
28138,Darryl,I was in The Whiz in high school.
28139,Andy,"That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says ""action."""
28140,Andy,"I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-"
28141,Dwight,"Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?"
28142,Dwight,"Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane."
28143,Kevin,Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
28144,Dwight,I call for a refold!
28145,Dwight,It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
28146,Kevin,"I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder."
28147,Angela,Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
28148,Kevin,I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
28149,Jim,An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
28150,Pam,"Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea."
28151,Jim,"Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip."
28152,Pam,"Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture."
28153,Andy," This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death."
28154,Andy,Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
28155,Andy,"So how do you want, how should I do it?"
28156,Andy, This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
28157,Andy,"It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster."
28158,Erin,Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
28159,Erin, I can't hear what you said.  You got your slop? 
28160,Angela,No you can't baby!  Good luck.
28161,Dwight,What are you-  You're here early.
28162,Dwight,I like a little feather in my nuggets. 
28163,Andy,Which is insanely painful.
28164,Andy,"And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain."
28165,Andy,So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
28166,Andy,"I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-"
28167,Andy,"Darryl, what do I do?"
28168,Darryl,"Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope."
28169,Andy,They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
28170,Andy,I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper.
28171,Angela, Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. 
28172,Dwight,"Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything."
28173,Dwight,"In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song."
28174,Andy,She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
28175,Darryl,Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
28176,Andy,Do you believe in me?
28177,Darryl,I believe I want to go home.
28178,Dwight, Yeah! Ok! Beat that!  Whoo! Ok.
28179,Erin,"Dammit! Dammit, god.  Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels."
28180,Erin,Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
28181,Erin,Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
28182,Pam,"Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting."
28183,Jim,"Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar."
28184,Pam,I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
28185,Jim,Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
28186,Pam,"Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- "
28187,Jim,"Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good."
28188,Pam,"Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.  I appreciate the sacrifice."
28189,Jim,"Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair."
28190,Pam,"Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?"
28191,Jim,I guess I will swallow my truth.
28192,Pam,I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
28193,Kevin,The Mark 47 is ready for launch.  Less paste.
28194,Andy, AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
28195,Andy,I can do a better one.
28196,Andy,I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
28197,Angela,Thank you.  Oh god!
28198,Dwight," Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. "
28199,Angela,Don't you dare tank this. 
28200,Angela," Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely."
28201,Angela,"I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok."
28202,Jim,"I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?"
28203,Pam,"Alright, have a good trip."
28204,Jim,"I'm taking some time off from work�well, my other work�because we needed it."
28205,Pam,The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
28206,Jim,But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together.
28207,Jim,"Beesly! Oh, my god."
28208,Andy,Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial.
28209,Andy,"Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond?"
28210,Jim,"For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin�"
28211,Andy,Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
28212,Jim,"Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once you know."
28213,Andy,"Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup."
28214,Jim,"Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing."
28215,Angela,No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
28216,Kevin,"Wait, all of them?"
28217,Angela,"Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house."
28218,Oscar,"That's�that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry."
28219,Angela,"It's the  that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type."
28220,Kevin,I've never met anyone like that.
28221,Angela,"And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone."
28222,Oscar,"Angela, you still have your son."
28223,Dwight,"Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office.  Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and�"
28224,Dwight,"Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts."
28225,Dwight,"I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt."
28226,Dwight,"I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided."
28227,Dwight,Ah!  That's how it's done.
28228,Jim,That's pretty good. I feel safe.
28229,Erin,"Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ""is Indian"" and was like, ""Is Indian what?"" Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way."
28230,Erin,"Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic."
28231,Erin,"Yes, there's Andy! Andy is in. I'm a good receptionist, I know he's in."
28232,Andy,"David Walrus, in his native habitat."
28233,Andy,"I'm gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream."
28234,Andy,"Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I'll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense."
28235,Andy,"At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany."
28236,Andy,"Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don't�it just... I owe it to myself and my future fans."
28237,Andy,Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry.
28238,Andy,Thank you. Not gonna need it.
28239,Jim,"Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back."
28240,Jim,You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.
28241,Pam,it's okay. You can sit in the annex.
28242,Pam,I'll come visit you.
28243,Jim,Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you.
28244,Andy,"Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever."
28245,Oscar,"I can't say we didn't see it coming. But it's a sad day when anybody is fired. We're so sorry, Andy."
28246,Andy,"I wasn't fired. What are you talking about? I'm fired up, yes. Guys, I'm�I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous."
28247,Andy,"Yeah, so, I'll see you on the red carpet. See, that's how it works."
28248,Jim,"Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark."
28249,Jim,"Oh, wow. But, um�Oh, I get that."
28250,Jim,"Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that."
28251,Darryl,I just think you're going into this a little fast.
28252,Andy,"I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?"
28253,Darryl,"Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack."
28254,Andy,All right. I get it.
28255,Andy,"The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel, that's chick stuff. So instead of saying, ""Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don't want you to leave."" You say something like, ""Hey, Andy, you're making the worst mistake of your life. You're not talented."" Well... right back at you, Darryl."
28256,Andy, I'm gonna miss you too. Mmm!
28257,Kevin,"Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!"
28258,Dwight,He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
28259,Dwight,"Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. "
28260,Dwight,Just slip it off my�Slip it off my hips.
28261,Dwight,He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
28262,Angela,"Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying."
28263,Dwight,"We did it, we did it. I love you."
28264,Dwight,Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?
28265,Dwight,"Sensei, you're not watching."
28266,Dwight,"Watch this part, okay?"
28267,Jim,"I really felt like I almost lost her, and�and nothing is worth that."
28268,Dwight,You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.
28269,Dwight,"Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager."
28270,Jim,Not at all. It should be Dwight.
28271,Jim,"You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh�"
28272,Jim,"Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person."
28273,Andy,It's now or never.
28274,Andy,"Yeah, sure. What's your question?"
28275,Kevin,Our question is�it seems dumb.
28276,Andy,"Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?"
28277,Andy,Nah. I like my plan better.
28278,Kevin,"Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor."
28279,Oscar,"No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?"
28280,Jim,"Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?"
28281,Jim,"I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens."
28282,Jim,"If you could help me out, that would be�"
28283,Pam,I could give you some beginner stickies?
28284,Jim,"Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that."
28285,Jim,You come so prepared. Aspirin.
28286,Dwight,"You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that."
28287,Jim,"Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great."
28288,Dwight,Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
28289,Jim,No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
28290,Dwight,"Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed."
28291,Jim,I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.
28292,Dwight,Big day for you.
28293,Andy,Big day for you.
28294,Andy,"You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!"
28295,Dwight,This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
28296,Andy,"Thank you, I appreciate that. �Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it."
28297,Dwight,"Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?"
28298,Andy,"No, I just applied for more overdraft protection."
28299,Dwight,"Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job."
28300,Andy," Nothing is impossible to him who will try.  Alexander the Great, if he were cockney."
28301,Andy,I'm gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
28302,Andy,"Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That's something you can't take back."
28303,Erin,"So true. Is there a question, or are�what?"
28304,Andy,"Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?"
28305,Erin,"Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve."
28306,Dwight,"I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun."
28307,Dwight,But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute...  Manager.
28308,Dwight,"In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David."
28309,Dwight,"I will never, ever let you down."
28310,Pam,"Um, I have a question."
28311,Pam,"Oh, I had a question."
28312,Jim,"Yeah, totally you did."
28313,Jim,I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
28314,Jim,All right? I'm gonna wait.
28315,Pam,All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
28316,Jim,I'm sure you did not. What was your question?
28317,Pam,"I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out."
28318,Jim,"Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting."
28319,Andy,"Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales."
28320,Kevin,"Ooh, there's a great play about a salesman."
28321,Andy,Death of a salesman.
28322,Kevin,I don't think so.
28323,Andy,"Sure, �Death of a Salesman' by Arthur Miller, it's a great play about crushed dreams."
28324,Kevin,"No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants."
28325,Andy, Got any hot leads?
28326,Erin,I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep.
28327,Pam,"I'm back. Oh, hey, look, and now it's like a double date."
28328,Erin,"Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That'd be fun."
28329,Pam,"Yeah, we should do that for real sometime."
28330,Erin,"Well, how about Thursday?"
28331,Pam,"Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of�"
28332,Jim,Weeknights are actually tough just because�
28333,Erin,Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
28334,Dwight,"David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?"
28335,Dwight,It's just one thing. Just let me�let me do this�
28336,Dwight,Just wait and send it to voicemail.
28337,Dwight,Come on. Come on.
28338,Dwight, Dwight Schrute is manager! 
28339,Kevin,Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it.
28340,Dwight,Get out of Jim's seat.
28341,Dwight,"You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram."
28342,Pam,It's nice to have you back.
28343,Dwight,I wanted to offer you a new position.
28344,Jim,Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.
28345,Jim,I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.
28346,Dwight,"Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot."
28347,Jim,"Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus."
28348,Dwight,"So, all the numbers adding up?"
28349,Oscar,"Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight."
28350,Kevin,"Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations."
28351,Angela,This is a big day for you.
28352,Dwight,"Yes, it is. Carry on."
28353,Andy,"How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It's cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself."
28354,Andy,Everyone! Changed my mind again.
28355,Andy,"Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?"
28356,Jim,"Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice."
28357,Andy,"Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all."
28358,Andy,"Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners."
28359,Andy,"Come on, just do it."
28360,Andy,"All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. "
28361,Andy,"God, Toby, don't�stop blocking my hand."
28362,Andy,This is your�you brought this on.
28363,Andy,"Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!"
28364,Angela," This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. And�oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um... what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! "
28365,Kevin,What do you think that was about?
28366,Andy,"David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite."
28367,Andy,What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
28368,Andy,"Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?"
28369,Andy,"Eleanor Roosevelt once said �the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.'  I think she's right.  I feel calm now.  I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing."
28370,Angela,What are you doing?
28371,Andy,"Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top."
28372,Angela,"Yeah, okay. That's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it."
28373,Andy,"Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too�"
28374,Andy,But I just�it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't...
28375,Angela,"No, none�No, stop. It's just�"
28376,Angela,"Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy."
28377,Andy,"Thanks, Angela. You too."
28378,Andy,"A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how."
28379,Jim,"You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye."
28380,Andy,"Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall. "
28381,Angela, It's just a really nice song.
28382,Oscar,Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
28383,Angela,"Well, I've changed my mind."
28384,Oscar,Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in a�
28385,Angela,"Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?"
28386,Oscar,"Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent."
28387,Oscar,Come stay with me.
28388,Angela,You don't want me at your place.
28389,Oscar,I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.
28390,Oscar,You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff...
28391,Oscar,And get you the hell outta that place.
28392,Angela,Are you allowed to have pets?
28393,Dwight,"Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day."
28394,Darryl,You talk to Wade and Colin?
28395,Jim,"No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?"
28396,Darryl,We got an offer on the table.
28397,Jim,What kind of offer?
28398,Darryl,"We're in play, baby."
28399,Darryl,"We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it's not just a Philly play, so get this: they're gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby."
28400,Jim,"Wow, that is... wow."
28401,Darryl,"Yeah, we did it."
28402,Jim,"Yeah, we did. Hey, how long�how long do we think that's gonna take?"
28403,Darryl,Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
28404,Jim,"Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it."
28405,Jim,"This, man. I can't do this to Pam."
28406,Darryl,"No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything."
28407,Jim,I know. And I can't do it.
28408,Angela,So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
28409,Oscar,"No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up."
28410,Angela,I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy.
28411,Oscar,"Angela, you just were�"
28412,Oscar,"I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You�you can't�"
28413,Angela,"No, not the senator. I love Dwight."
28414,Erin,The tea in Nepal is very hot.
28415,Kevin,But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. 
28416,Dwight,"Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they're protecting America's real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day's security codes. Something that's been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It's not the KGB, but it's a start."
28417,Erin,The tea in Nepal is very hot.
28418,Dwight,But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
28419,Dwight,"This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?"
28420,Dwight,The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
28421,Erin,"No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, ""the coffee in Peru is much hotter."""
28422,Erin,"But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam.  Unless you want me to break protocol?"
28423,Dwight,"No, no. Give me the steam."
28424,Dwight,"It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd."
28425,Dwight, Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
28426,Oscar,"Angela, someone wants you."
28427,Angela,"Ok, coming. Hi, baby."
28428,Oscar,"Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o."
28429,Oscar,Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
28430,Dwight,"Oh, don't worry. They'll get got."
28431,Dwight,Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check... on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
28432,Andy,"Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick."
28433,Andy,"Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!"
28434,Jim,Sales form for you to sign.
28435,Dwight,You know what to do.  Ok
28436,Dwight,"Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best."
28437,Dwight,"Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War�"
28438,Dwight,Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
28439,Jim,Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
28440,Pam,"Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting."
28441,Jim,"All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay."
28442,Pam,Is that them again?
28443,Pam,Maybe you should call back?
28444,Jim,I will. I will.
28445,Jim,"The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I'm not risking that again."
28446,Pam,"When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim."
28447,Dwight,Please take an agenda item.
28448,Jim,Your agenda-taking pleases him.
28449,Dwight,"Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ""Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.""  That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you."
28450,Jim,"Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, ""Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future."" Ok? That's nonsense."
28451,Jim,"Yes, beautiful girl in the front."
28452,Pam,"We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ""Nice jugs""?"
28453,Jim,That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
28454,Dwight, What is going on?
28455,Angela,Daycare won't take Phillip anymore.
28456,Angela,"Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi."
28457,Dwight,"Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today."
28458,Jim,"Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?"
28459,Dwight,"I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month."
28460,Kevin,"Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions."
28461,Oscar,"I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having s*x with women. As was Kevin, I believe."
28462,Andy,"This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ""I Dreamed a Dream"" from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic."
28463,Andy,"No, this is my time! You don't belt on my time! I belt on my time."
28464,Angela,Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
28465,Oscar,Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
28466,Angela,"Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong."
28467,Angela,Why don't you pack it?
28468,Kevin,"Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ""bold front"" instead of ""cold front""? It's insane."
28469,Angela,"Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks."
28470,Oscar,"Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store."
28471,Angela,"Ok, you go to the store."
28472,Kevin,"Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip."
28473,Dwight,Not now! Private time!
28474,Jim,I love Star Wars as much as the next guy�
28475,Jim,"My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN."
28476,Dwight,"Which is, of course..."
28477,Dwight,"Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me."
28478,Jim,I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.
28479,Jim,"Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager."
28480,Dwight,"A loyal, but bungling apostle."
28481,Jim,But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
28482,Dwight,Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
28483,Dwight,"I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?"
28484,Jim,"Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests."
28485,Dwight,I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
28486,Jim,"Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?"
28487,Dwight,"That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard."
28488,Andy,"Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440."
28489,Andy,"A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch."
28490,Andy,What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
28491,Andy,Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
28492,Andy,I don't know where it came from.
28493,Andy,"Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny."
28494,Andy,"I did, I felt it."
28495,Pam,What are you so excited about?
28496,Pam,What are you up to?
28497,Jim,"Members of the office, hear ye."
28498,Dwight,"That means ye, Plop!"
28499,Dwight,We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
28500,Jim,Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
28501,Dwight,"You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending."
28502,Jim,"This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring."
28503,Dwight,"Wow, the honor. God, I envy them."
28504,Dwight,"You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it."
28505,Jim,"By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me."
28506,Darryl,"Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here."
28507,Darryl,"I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all."
28508,Jim,"A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?"
28509,Dwight,"Not even close, Meredith. Come on!"
28510,Jim,"Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?"
28511,Pam,Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
28512,Jim,"Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World."
28513,Dwight,"Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job."
28514,Jim,"That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?"
28515,Jim,"Ew, the exact opposite, actually."
28516,Jim,Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna�
28517,Jim,"Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?"
28518,Jim,Do you want a corn dog?
28519,Jim,"We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message."
28520,Dwight,"No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations."
28521,Andy,"Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you."
28522,Andy,Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
28523,Andy,Me too. Hold my place in line.
28524,Andy,They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
28525,Pam,"Cool, are you coming back to say hi?"
28526,Darryl,"No, no, I'm not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn't say goodbye to."
28527,Darryl,We livin' like rock stars. I'm about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
28528,Darryl,Jim really doesn't want to come?
28529,Pam,He says he doesn't want to.
28530,Darryl,Wow. Man. I hope he doesn't regret it.
28531,Pam,"Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin."
28532,Darryl,"Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?"
28533,Pam,That's what he says.
28534,Darryl,"If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then."
28535,Jim,"An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?"
28536,Dwight,A thousand times more.
28537,Jim,"Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course."
28538,Jim,"Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!"
28539,Dwight," No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?"
28540,Jim,Look at that form.
28541,Dwight," Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee!  Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!"
28542,Darryl,"Oh, hey. Hey, what's up, y'all?"
28543,Erin,You left us without saying goodbye.
28544,Darryl,"Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody."
28545,Erin,Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
28546,Darryl,I don't think I sh-
28547,Darryl,Guess I'm going upstairs.
28548,Jim,"You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing�none of these people are good enough."
28549,Jim,"What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said."
28550,Dwight,"Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-"
28551,Jim,The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
28552,Jim,"I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  That's it. You look really, really good."
28553,Dwight,"Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?"
28554,Jim,You all right? What's going on?
28555,Pam,"No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today."
28556,Pam,And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
28557,Pam,What about five years from now?
28558,Pam,"Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just�I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much."
28559,Jim,"This was my decision, not yours."
28560,Jim,You didn't force me.
28561,Pam,I kind of forced you to do it.
28562,Jim,You did not force me to do this.
28563,Jim,I don't know how else to tell you.
28564,Pam,I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that�
28565,Pam,This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.
28566,Jim,Is that really what you think?
28567,Jim,"Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys."
28568,Darryl,I didn't realize we were this close.
28569,Darryl,Uh... yeah. Depending on traffic.
28570,Darryl,These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
28571,Darryl,"Well, it's been great."
28572,Oscar,"Did we ever have lunch together, just�just the two of us? You know what, I'm gonna make reservations right now at Cugino's."
28573,Darryl,"Oh, oh, I'm sure we did."
28574,Erin,"Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we'll get this started."
28575,Darryl,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental."
28576,Darryl,"Hey, hey, hey. I'll do one thing with y'all."
28577,Darryl,"I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though."
28578,Kevin,"Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. "
28579,Angela,"Kevin, could you not do that?"
28580,Kevin,"What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work."
28581,Oscar,"Here, use my pen."
28582,Kevin,Don't tell me what to do!
28583,Kevin,"No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me."
28584,Angela,"Kevin, where are you going?"
28585,Kevin,Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
28586,Oscar,He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper.
28587,Angela,I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
28588,Dwight,Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.
28589,Andy,"Hey, what's goin' on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young'uns?"
28590,Andy,"No, it's me, Andy!"
28591,Andy,"No, no, no. I'm wearing makeup."
28592,Andy,"Oh, I took out my lifts."
28593,Andy,"Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height."
28594,Dwight,"Oink the pigs, that is very important. "
28595,Dwight,The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
28596,Jim,"You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?"
28597,Dwight,I need you to perform a test.
28598,Dwight,On an innocent baby.
28599,Jim,"Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz."
28600,Jim,Unless you think he can't handle it.
28601,Dwight,"Hey, he can handle it."
28602,Oscar," Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley's sleeping. You don't want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?"
28603,Dwight,"Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps."
28604,Pam,He does have a gift.
28605,Oscar,"Well, he's calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites."
28606,Dwight,Okay.  You ever been in a manager's office before?
28607,Dwight,"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called ""Schrute or Consequences."" You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?"
28608,Dwight,"Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes."
28609,Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?"
28610,Andy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. You can't do that, we've all been waiting."
28611,Andy,I am going in there! Don't�
28612,Oscar,Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
28613,Dwight,That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
28614,Kevin,He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.
28615,Andy," Hi. You're still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're like, my three favorite people ever."
28616,Andy," Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show, so it's someone else's turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right,  my name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart."
28617,Andy,"Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that."
28618,Andy,"Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern."
28619,Andy,"That's�that's what�yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song.  Far above Cayuga's waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater�"
28620,Andy,Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song.
28621,Andy,You didn't let me finish. That's not fair.
28622,Andy,"Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. Let me try a different song, okay?"
28623,Andy," Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you're never fully dressed without a smile.  Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly�"
28624,Andy,Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
28625,Oscar,"Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?"
28626,Kevin,Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
28627,Oscar,"Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something."
28628,Angela,"Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes."
28629,Oscar,"I think there's, like, $7 left."
28630,Angela,"It's just his way of saying, ""Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting."""
28631,Kevin,Phillip got this for me?
28632,Kevin,That was a really cool move.
28633,Angela,Would you like to hold Phillip?  Yeah. That's Kevin.
28634,Kevin,What a chubbers. Whoa.
28635,Kevin,I'm losing my balance.
28636,Kevin,You wanna play with the cactus?
28637,Kevin,"So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you."
28638,Erin,We have our decision.
28639,Darryl,You chose one thing?
28640,Erin,We want to dance with you.
28641,Darryl,You want to dance?
28642,Erin,"One dance, all of us together."
28643,Darryl,This is what you want?
28644,Darryl,"Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we're gonna do this right."
28645,Angela,Hey. You wanted to see me?
28646,Dwight,Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
28647,Angela,I am sorry he's here today but I had�
28648,Dwight,"I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal."
28649,Dwight,"Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet."
28650,Angela,"If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son."
28651,Angela,Can I go back to my desk now?
28652,Jim,"Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so  I needed a little help."
28653,Dwight,Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
28654,Jim,"OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so."
28655,Jim,"I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip."
28656,Dwight,Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
28657,Jim,"Ok, um, this is... �I'll be right back."
28658,Jim,What do we got?
28659,Dwight,I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
28660,Jim,"Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step."
28661,Dwight,"She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest."
28662,Jim,Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.
28663,Dwight,"Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm."
28664,Jim, That's a lot of pros.
28665,Dwight,"And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up."
28666,Jim,So what is the problem?
28667,Jim,"I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation."
28668,Dwight,Some sort of virus?
28669,Jim,"Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have."
28670,Dwight,"You're a good assistant, Jim."
28671,Jim,Not as good as you.
28672,Dwight,That's very true. Get the hell outta here.
28673,Jim,"Well, then I guess you're ready for this. "
28674,Jim,It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything.
28675,Darryl,I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys.
28676,Oscar,"Ok, I've got my�"
28677,Kevin,"Bye, Phillip. High five."
28678,Oscar,"Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at Poor Richard's in an hour."
28679,Angela,Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off?
28680,Oscar,She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up.
28681,Angela,"All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!"
28682,Dwight,Move to the side of the road!
28683,Angela, Dwight! What the  is your problem!
28684,Angela,Who drives like that?
28685,Dwight,Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
28686,Angela,Can you put that down?
28687,Dwight,This expresses how loudly I love you.
28688,Dwight," This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites."
28689,Angela,"Okay, yes�yes, I will!  I love you!"
28690,Angela,And I lied to you.
28691,Dwight,What? Why would you say that�
28692,Angela,I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
28693,Dwight, Get out! I'm a dad!
28694,Erin,You have to change the channel to PBS.
28695,Erin,But there's a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
28696,Kevin,"Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places."
28697,Andy,One more for the doc. 
28698,Andy,"Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal."
28699,Kevin,I feel scared a little.
28700,Oscar,"One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same."
28701,Dwight,The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
28702,Dwight,"pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore."
28703,Dwight,PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
28704,Dwight,"In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a ""where are they now"" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again.  I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go."
28705,Dwight," Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring."
28706,Kevin,"Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!"
28707,Dwight,No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin.
28708,Dwight,Go ahead and just read the frosting.
28709,Kevin,What does that mean?
28710,Dwight,"It's a colloquial way of saying ""you're fired,"" Kevin, which you are."
28711,Pam,"What? Dwight, you can't do that."
28712,Dwight,The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
28713,Dwight,Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
28714,Pam,"Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so..."
28715,Dwight,"Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake.  Bye, bye Toby."
28716,Kevin, At least I got chocolate.
28717,Jim,"I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too."
28718,Jim,Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
28719,Jim, Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
28720,Jim,And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
28721,Pam," Angela, are you ready for the wedding?"
28722,Angela," Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace.  Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet. They're like the paws of an orangutan."
28723,Pam,"I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much."
28724,Dwight,That is all. Have a good morning.
28725,Dwight, What was that for?
28726,Angela, To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful.
28727,Dwight,Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
28728,Angela,"D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me."
28729,Dwight,"Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him."
28730,Angela,I don't...I don't know why.
28731,Dwight,"I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ""The Grass Roots"" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military."
28732,Jim,"Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready �cause I want to pack in a lot."
28733,Jim,"Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?"
28734,Jim,"Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. ""Guten Pranken"". "
28735,Dwight,"Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight."
28736,Jim,"Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?"
28737,Dwight,"Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing."
28738,Jim,Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.
28739,Andy,"Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say"
28740,Andy,"Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!"
28741,Andy,Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
28742,Andy,"After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group.  Not really my scene."
28743,Oscar," Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you...hold on."
28744,Oscar,"That's the reason Kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight,  ""A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven."" He was home by 4:45 that day."
28745,Jim,"Hey man, good to see you."
28746,Andy,Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
28747,Andy, Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
28748,Andy,Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
28749,Darryl,What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
28750,Darryl,"Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um...I didn't call �cause I figured you changed the number."
28751,Andy,No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
28752,Dwight,I thought you guys couldn't come.
28753,Darryl,"Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet."
28754,Jim,"Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ""Guten Prank"" number one."
28755,Darryl,You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
28756,Dwight,"Uh, better ask Jim."
28757,Jim,And Jim will say nothing.
28758,Darryl,"Hey, Pam! How are you?"
28759,Pam,We're fine. Yeah.  And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?
28760,Pam,"Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time."
28761,Darryl,I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
28762,Darryl,"Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real."
28763,Jim,"Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to."
28764,Pam,"Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy."
28765,Darryl,Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever.
28766,Oscar,They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
28767,Dwight,"Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary."
28768,Dwight,"Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim?"
28769,Jim,"No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking."
28770,Dwight,A bazooka. You remembered.
28771,Jim,Of course I did.
28772,Dwight,. Get out of my way.
28773,Jim,Yeah!  Guten Prank number two.
28774,Jim,"Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?"
28775,Andy,"Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral."
28776,Darryl,That happens a lot?
28777,Andy,"Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success."
28778,Oscar,"Well, I bet it was a smash."
28779,Andy,That's how I got my new job in the admissions office.
28780,Oscar,Is that a volunteer program or...
28781,Andy,No. It's a job. Things are going great.
28782,Darryl,"Let's get a drink in you, huh?"
28783,Angela,This is my big sister Rachel.
28784,Angela, We're very close. We even have our own special language.
28785,Dwight," Man, how long have we been sitting here?"
28786,Dwight,"Oh, Thank God. We are famished!"
28787,Dwight,"No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special? "
28788,Dwight,"Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups."
28789,Dwight,"Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?"
28790,Dwight,"Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good."
28791,Angela,"Wait, what is this?"
28792,Pam,"Uh, that seems inappropriate."
28793,Pam,"Whoo-hoo...go, Meredith's stripper son."
28794,Angela,"Rachel, are you all right?"
28795,Angela,"Oh geeze. . Oh, my God!"
28796,Angela,"Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith."
28797,Angela," Uh, no. It's o...thank you. You know what? You don't have to...oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay."
28798,Dwight,"Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic."
28799,Oscar,"If you want her to leave, just tip her."
28800,Dwight,"What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato?  Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?"
28801,Angela,That was interesting.  What was that?
28802,Angela,Will you lock the door?
28803,Angela,"Alright, see, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut... OH! My God!"
28804,Dwight,"Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. "
28805,Jim,"Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled."
28806,Jim,They think it was Mose.
28807,Dwight,"Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung."
28808,Dwight,"A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose."
28809,Jim,Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?
28810,Dwight,Right. Which one is that?
28811,Jim,"Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?"
28812,Dwight,"Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!"
28813,Dwight,Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  Oh.
28814,Kevin,"Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six ""wells."" Did I get that number right, Dwight?"
28815,Dwight,"I heard you bought a bar, Kevin."
28816,Kevin,Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
28817,Dwight, Why did you pick this place? 
28818,Dwight,You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
28819,Jim,"Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet."
28820,Dwight,Waste of a good hatchet.
28821,Dwight,"I heard you say ""well"" the first time."
28822,Jim,I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.
28823,Dwight,It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.
28824,Kevin,You're just saying that to make me feel better.
28825,Dwight,"No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer."
28826,Kevin,Is that all it was?
28827,Dwight,I missed you Kevin.
28828,Jim,"Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three."
28829,Dwight,You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
28830,Angela,What the  is your problem you   ?!
28831,Jim,"Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or..."
28832,Dwight,No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
28833,Jim,Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
28834,Pam,"No, no, I'm fine."
28835,Jim,Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
28836,Andy,I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
28837,Kevin, People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
28838,Kevin," Yeah, people hate you."
28839,Andy,I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. 
28840,Dwight,With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
28841,Pam,"Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something."
28842,Jim,She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.
28843,Pam, I'm sorry. Is there a question?
28844,Pam,"Oh, um, well, you know, I... I just... I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself."
28845,Jim,"Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish."
28846,Pam,"Listen, um... I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end. And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it."
28847,Pam,"Yeah, like Harry Potter."
28848,Erin,"Maybe sometimes. But not like ""hate"" hate. More just like, ""Mom, I hate you!"" And then she would say ""go to your room, young lady."" And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks."
28849,Erin,Yes? Is there a follow-up question?  Mom? 
28850,Kevin,"Where's the, uh, basket for gifts?"
28851,Ryan,"No, this little guy is mine."
28852,Ryan,"So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. "
28853,Ryan,"No Kelly, he's no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It's Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake."
28854,Pam,"Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high."
28855,Angela,"No, my heels aren't too high. It's because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis.  Sorry Phyllis. You didn't know. As long as I can get to the altar."
28856,Dwight, You kidding? I was born ready. 
28857,Jim,"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but... we have a little bit of a problem."
28858,Jim,The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
28859,Dwight,"Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing."
28860,Jim,"I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-"
28861,Dwight,Not... significant is a big word...
28862,Jim,"I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way..."
28863,Dwight,I think you're only a teeny...
28864,Jim,"Either way, Dwight... I can't be there for you. I'm sorry."
28865,Jim,I just...really wish there was something I could do. 
28866,Dwight,  Michael. I can't believe you came.
28867,Michael,That's what she said.
28868,Kevin," ""Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. """
28869,Dwight,"Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab �em on in there."
28870,Jim," See, now you don't owe me anything."
28871,Ryan,Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he's hot.
28872,Ryan,I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
28873,Ryan,"Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water."
28874,Ryan,Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
28875,Ryan,He'll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He's allergic but he'll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
28876,Pam,Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
28877,Pam," Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!"
28878,Pam,He just so happy to have a family plan.
28879,Erin,I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.
28880,Pam,Is it me? Is it Nellie?
28881,Ryan,We're gonna be together forever.
28882,Ryan,I finally mastered commitment.
28883,Kevin, What was that stuff?
28884,Kevin,"Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together."
28885,Kevin,"Oh, I don't know."
28886,Kevin,"Hey, this is better. "
28887,Michael, I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
28888,Darryl,Thank you go much.
28889,Darryl,"Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame.  No offense. You going, Toby?"
28890,Andy,"It's only 6:00. Come on, everybody's going."
28891,Pam,I need to get out of this dress.
28892,Jim,I gotta get out of this dress.
28893,Pam,  Why are you still here?
28894,Jim,"No, really, what's going on?"
28895,Pam,"Okay, Okay. Um... so... this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just... I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture... and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future."
28896,Jim,"Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?"
28897,Jim,That's why it's so clean.
28898,Jim,"I mean, you were gonna do this without me?"
28899,Pam,"Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you."
28900,Jim,Oh... okay. Where would we go?
28901,Jim,"I promise you, you don't have to do this for me."
28902,Pam,I'm doing it for us.
28903,Jim, Hold on a second.  The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about...
28904,Pam,"Hold on a second.  Wait, what did you just say?"
28905,Jim,You wanna do this?
28906,Pam,I wanna do this.
28907,Jim,You really want to do this?
28908,Pam,I really want to do this!
28909,Pam,"Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper...,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim.  And go ahead! "
28910,Pam,"Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just...I kind of meant just everybody from the office."
28911,Kevin,"Yeah, we all need a drink.  What the...there's only dandelion tea and raisins in here."
28912,Pam," Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore."
28913,Pam,"I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But...it would just...just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ""be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long."""
28914,Kevin,"If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural."
28915,Pam,What about the honeymoon?
28916,Angela,"Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?"
28917,Dwight,"Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun?  What is that meaningful look?"
28918,Jim,You know what? Maybe we should talk.
28919,Darryl,"Hey, come here. You guys need to see this."
28920,Andy, You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
28921,Pam,I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing...
28922,Pam,And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially...
28923,Dwight,"No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!"
28924,Jim,"Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note."
28925,Dwight,Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
28926,Jim,"Hey, and if you're ever in Austin..."
28927,Dwight,"Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn."
28928,Dwight,"Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So... have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So...yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates."
28929,Andy," You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: : Oh, I can so just sit here and cry."
28930,Darryl,You did good. Real good.
28931,Andy,"I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.  Someone should write a song about that."
28932,Oscar,"You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way...And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami."
28933,Jim,"Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's...an amazing gift."
28934,Angela,Do you even have a mattress?
28935,Kevin,Oscar. Oscar.  I think I'm gay.
28936,Oscar,Why do you say that?
28937,Kevin, It's just that I'm so emotional.
28938,Oscar,"Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay."
28939,Kevin,"No, but maybe the reason..."
28940,Erin,"How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?"
28941,Darryl,"Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?"
28942,Jim,"I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid...wonderful...boring...amazing job."
28943,Pam,I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all...I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?
